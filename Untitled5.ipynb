            "The essence of the essay is to explain how the writer stumbled upon the idea of Y Combinator, a venture capital firm that helps startups, and how it has grown and evolved over the years. It also explains how the writer's experiences with writing essays, painting, cooking, and investing led to the creation of Y Combinator and how it has become a successful venture capital firm. Additionally, the essay details the struggles the writer faced while running Y Combinator, such as disputes between cofounders, figuring out when people were lying to them, and fighting with people who maltreated the startups. Finally, the essay reveals how a piece of advice from Robert Morris led the writer to realize that Y Combinator should not be the last cool thing they do.\n"
