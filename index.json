ChatGPT is a chatbot capable of understanding context and generating more sophisticated and nuanced responses based on the input it receives. Whether it is creating email sales campaigns, fixing computer code, or creating top-notch articles, language models like ChatGPT can automate tedious tasks and streamline workflows. So, in today\u2019s highly competitive market, leveraging chatbots is no longer a luxury for businesses; it\u2019s a necessity. Whether you are a small startup or a large corporation, incorporating chatbots like ChatGPT into your operations will give you the competitive edge you need to succeed. This is one major reason behind the proliferation of the chatbot market in recent times.\n\nThe chatbot market is predicted to explode in the coming years, with research firm Gartner projecting it to reach almost $134.8 billion by 2025. This growth is set to outpace the overall software market growth, going from 14.4% in 2021 to a staggering 31.1% in 2025. Interestingly, a significant share of this market will be dominated by chatbot technology, which utilizes artificial intelligence and natural language processing to respond to user queries the same way as humans do.\n\nHowever, businesses must exercise quality control over the generated content to ensure its accuracy and consistency. ChatGPT can draw data from various channels to compile general-purpose aggregated data in a chosen style or format. This means enterprise end-users can leverage this technology to generate resources such as research documents, marketing content, instructional material, and translations. The leading use case for enterprise chatbots is in customer experience solutions, with data indicating that 23% of customer service companies already use AI chatbots to engage with customers.\n\nWith the chatbot market growing unabated, businesses can\u2019t afford to ignore this trend. With Meta\u2019s Messenger service operating 300,000 chatbots, it\u2019s clear that chatbots are becoming an increasingly popular way for businesses to engage with customers. In fact, Userlike reports that 80% of customers are already using chatbots at some point during their buying journey. While chatbot technology is not without its flaws, emerging solutions like ChatGPT still provide a reliable way to create instant content. While there may be some \u201cuncanny valley\u201d qualities to contend with, the benefits of leveraging this technology far outweigh any potential drawbacks.\n\nThis article discusses the most useful ChatGPT use cases for enterprises.\n\nChatGPT and the underlying technology\nAdvantages of ChatGPT\nEnterprise ChatGPT use cases and their solutions\nImportance of maintaining quality control over the content\nChatGPT and the underlying technology\nThere are two main phases in how ChatGPT operates. Let\u2019s take an analogy of Google search. When you type in a query on Google, you might assume that it instantly combs through every page on the web. But in reality, Google has two key phases: first, it crawls and collects data and then uses that information to respond to user searches. At its core, ChatGPT operates in a similar manner. The initial stage, pre-training, involves gathering data, while the second phase, inference, is focused on user interactions. The real marvel of generative AI is how incredibly scalable the pre-training phase has become, which is why this technology has exploded in popularity.\n\nWe need to look into several phases while discussing how generative AI technology works behind the operations of ChatGPT.\n\nPre-training ChatGPT\nSimply put, AI pre-training can be done in two ways: supervised and non-supervised. Before generative AI systems like ChatGPT, the supervised approach was typically used, where a model is trained on labeled data with corresponding inputs and outputs. However, this method has limitations and can be time-consuming, especially for complex subjects. This is where non-supervised pre-training comes in and changes the game. With non-supervised pre-training, a model is trained on data without specific outputs for each input but rather to understand the underlying patterns and structures in the data. This process is often used in unsupervised learning tasks and can be used in language", "doc_id": "78f6d5e4-d61a-4d60-b6ed-68d2bd10576b", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "a0a9b1dead21f900ea149a5809fbf197fb2ec983300161483750789b4e91c5ef", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 121296, "end": 136614}, "relationships": {"1": "d9152908-bd15-4715-85df-a4e7536a87b3", "2": "cb790c1e-70d1-4d2d-9a58-4cc7d242a6e4", "3": "633570a9-2647-4630-aa5d-017c51bcb8a1"}, "__type__": "1"}, "633570a9-2647-4630-aa5d-017c51bcb8a1": {"text": "exploded in popularity.\n\nWe need to look into several phases while discussing how generative AI technology works behind the operations of ChatGPT.\n\nPre-training ChatGPT\nSimply put, AI pre-training can be done in two ways: supervised and non-supervised. Before generative AI systems like ChatGPT, the supervised approach was typically used, where a model is trained on labeled data with corresponding inputs and outputs. However, this method has limitations and can be time-consuming, especially for complex subjects. This is where non-supervised pre-training comes in and changes the game. With non-supervised pre-training, a model is trained on data without specific outputs for each input but rather to understand the underlying patterns and structures in the data. This process is often used in unsupervised learning tasks and can be used in language modeling to generate coherent and meaningful text. This is the approach used by ChatGPT, which allows it to have seemingly limitless knowledge and expertise in various subjects.\n\nRather than anticipating every question that could be asked, ChatGPT\u2019s non-supervised pre-training mechanism, known as transformer-based language modeling, allows developers to input more and more information, letting the AI learn and understand the syntax and semantics of the natural language. This is the magic behind ChatGPT\u2019s ability to write a resume for a Star Trek character, explain quantum physics, write code, or compare the governing styles of former US presidents.\n\nHow transformer architecture plays a crucial role in NLP?\nThe transformer architecture is a game-changer in the field of natural language processing. Similar to how a hockey team works together to score a goal, a neural network processes information through interconnected nodes to simulate how the human brain works. The transformer architecture takes this a step further by processing sequences of words using \u201cself-attention\u201d to weigh the importance of different words in a sequence when making predictions. Self-attention is a powerful tool that allows the transformer to look back at all the words in a sequence to understand the context and relationships between them. Just like a reader might look back at a previous sentence or paragraph to understand a new word, the transformer uses self-attention to understand the meaning of words in a sequence.\n\nThe transformer comprises multiple layers, each with sub-layers that work together to understand the relationships between words in a sequence. The self-attention layer computes the importance of each word in the sequence, while the feedforward layer applies non-linear transformations to the input data. This powerful combination of layers allows the transformer to learn and understand the relationships between words, making it a powerful tool for language translation and text generation. During training, the transformer is given input data, such as a sentence, and is asked to make a prediction based on that input. As the transformer processes more data, it learns to understand the context and relationships between words, improving its accuracy over time, making highly accurate predictions and generating text almost indistinguishable from human writing.\n\nHow transformer architecture plays a crucial role in NLP icon\nTraining datasets\nChatGPT, a cutting-edge AI chatbot based on GPT-3 language model developed by OpenAI, has been trained on an enormous dataset consisting of over 45 terabytes of text data. Based on the GPT-3 architecture, ChatGPT has been fine-tuned on conversational datasets like Persona-Chat, which allows it to generate personalized and engaging responses to user queries. To train ChatGPT, OpenAI used a similar approach as the GPT series but with differences in architecture and training data. ChatGPT has 1.5 billion parameters, lower than GPT-3\u2019s 175 billion parameters. However, ChatGPT\u2019s training data is typically conversational in nature and is curated to include dialogues between humans, enabling it to generate natural and engaging responses in a conversational format.\n\nDuring unsupervised training, ChatGPT was fed a vast amount of data and left to its own devices to find patterns and make sense of all of it. This mechanism allowed the new generative AI systems to scale up quickly. In addition to Persona-Chat, ChatGPT was fine-tuned on other conversational datasets, such as Cornell Movie Dialogs Corpus, Ubuntu Dialogue Corpus, and DailyDialog. These datasets provide diverse and extensive conversational data that enables ChatGPT to understand and generate responses relevant to the specific context of the conversation.\n\nWhile pre-training does the heavy lifting for ChatGPT\u2019s generative AI, the inference phase consisting of natural language processing and dialog management, is responsible for understanding questions and constructing answers from all that data. ChatGPT\u2019s massive training data and carefully curated conversational datasets have made it a powerful tool for generating coherent and contextually relevant responses to user queries.\n\nDialogue management\nChatGPT\u2019s ability to engage in multi-turn conversations and provide personalized responses results from its advanced dialogue management capabilities. Using algorithms and machine learning techniques, ChatGPT can understand the context of a conversation and maintain it over multiple exchanges with the user. This creates a more natural and engaging experience that can help build trust and ultimately lead to better outcomes.\n\nHowever, it\u2019s important to acknowledge the potential risks associated with this technology. Marketers, in particular, may be tempted to use this advanced dialogue management to manipulate users. Ethical considerations must be considered to ensure that ChatGPT is used responsibly. Despite these concerns, the benefits of ChatGPT\u2019s dialogue management capabilities are clear, and it has the potential to revolutionize how we interact with technology. By creating a more human-like experience, ChatGPT has the potential to build stronger connections between users and organizations.\n\nAdvantages of ChatGPT\nChatGPT\u2019s GPT-3 model may be considered to be at the top of the list of AI language models that exist today. Here are the reasons:\n\nVersatility: GPT-3 is a highly versatile AI language model capable of handling a wide range of topics and questions while providing accurate and relevant responses, regardless of the industry or context.\nNatural communication: ChatGPT is designed to communicate in natural language, which helps put users at ease and creates a more engaging experience. With ChatGPT, users feel like they are interacting with a real human, making their overall experience much more positive.\nContextual understanding: Due to its massive training data, ChatGPT has developed a deep understanding of language and context, allowing it to generate accurate responses tailored to users\u2019 needs.\nOpen-ended responses: ChatGPT can generate open-ended responses, enabling it to continue conversing with users and provide additional information based on their previous interactions. This creates a more interactive experience and helps users get the necessary information.\nLearning ability: ChatGPT can learn and adapt based on new data and user interactions while constantly improving its performance and providing more personalized support to users.\nOverall, ChatGPT has the potential to revolutionize the way businesses and individuals interact with AI support tools. With its versatility, natural communication style, contextual understanding, open-ended responses, and learning ability, ChatGPT can enhance the user experience and help businesses and individuals achieve their goals.\u200d\n\nEnterprise ChatGPT use cases and their solutions\nIn today\u2019s fast-paced business landscape, enterprises embracing cutting-edge conversational AI technology like ChatGPT are setting themselves ahead of the competition in terms of productivity. This powerful tool is helping businesses streamline operations and improve customer engagement, all while reducing costs and boosting productivity. Here are some of the ChatGPT use cases that enterprises are already leveraging to reap different benefits:\n\nEnterprise ChatGPT use cases and their solutions\nChatGPT use case 1: Text analysis \nChatGPT can analyze structured data pasted along with an instruction prompt, such as a spreadsheet or report. Once the structured data is pasted, the instruction prompt can guide the specific type of analysis that needs to be performed on it. For example, the prompt could request a statistical analysis of the data, a comparison of two or more sets of data, or the identification of trends and patterns. For example, you can provide a prompt like: Analyze these survey results <paste survey> or Analyze why Alice left the company <transcript of HR meetings>. ChatGPT can then use its machine learning algorithms to analyze the data and provide insights based on the specific instruction prompt. The AI model can also provide additional information and context based on its knowledge of the topic and its ability to understand natural language. One of the advantages of using ChatGPT for text analysis is its ability to perform complex analysis quickly and accurately. The AI model can process large amounts of data quickly, and its machine-learning algorithms can identify patterns and trends that might not be immediately apparent to human analysts.\n\nSimilarly, enterprises can use ChatGPT to compare paragraphs using a prompt like: \u201cSpot the differences between these two paragraphs (Paragraph 1 and Paragraph 2 provided in the same prompt): To perform a comparison between two paragraphs and spot differences in words, named entities and other dimensions, ChatGPT would need to use a combination of natural language processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning algorithms.\n\nFirst, ChatGPT would use a pre-processing step to tokenize and normalize the two paragraphs, breaking them down into individual words and removing any stop words or other non-relevant words. Then, it would use a part-of-speech (POS) tagger to identify the grammatical structure of each sentence and extract named entities, such as people, places or organizations. Next, ChatGPT would use a similarity measure, such as the cosine similarity or Jaccard similarity, to compare the two paragraphs and identify any differences in the words used. This would involve calculating the similarity score between the two paragraphs based on the frequency of their common words.\n\nAdditionally, ChatGPT could use named entity recognition (NER) to identify any differences in named entities which would involve training a machine learning model on a large corpus of text to identify entities such as people, places or organizations and then using this model to extract named entities and compare them. Finally, ChatGPT could also use sentiment analysis or other text classification techniques to identify any overall tone or sentiment differences between the two paragraphs. By combining a range of NLP techniques and machine learning algorithms, ChatGPT can effectively compare two paragraphs and spot differences in words, named entities and other dimensions.\n\nChatGPT use case 2: Classification\nChatGPT uses machine learning algorithms to classify items based on examples provided. The process typically involves two main phases: training and prediction. During the training phase, ChatGPT is presented with labeled examples consisting of input data and their corresponding output labels. For example, if we want to classify emails as spam, we would provide ChatGPT with a set of emails already labeled as spam. Based on these examples, ChatGPT learns to recognize patterns in the input data that are indicative of the output labels.\n\nChatGPT uses a neural network architecture for classification tasks. This architecture consists of multiple layers of interconnected nodes, each performing a set of mathematical operations on the input data. The output of each layer is then passed on to the next layer until the final layer produces the output label. During the prediction phase, ChatGPT takes in new, unlabeled input data and uses the patterns it learned during the training phase to predict the corresponding output label. For example, if we want to classify a new email as spam, we would provide the email as input to ChatGPT, which would output its prediction of whether the email is spam.\n\nLet\u2019s take another example where a company wants to classify customer support emails into categories such as billing issues, technical problems, and general inquiries. They can train a ChatGPT model on a labeled email dataset. The model would learn to identify patterns in the text associated with each category, such as using certain keywords or phrases. Thus, when a new email arrives, the ChatGPT model can classify it into one of the categories based on the patterns it identifies in the text, allowing the company to automatically route the email to the appropriate support team or respond with a relevant template response.\n\nChatGPT relies on its internal representations of language to perform classification without example, which allows it to capture the key features and concepts relevant to different categories. These internal representations are based on the contextual relationships between words and phrases in the text and the statistical patterns of word usage across different contexts. When presented with new text to classify, ChatGPT can analyze the underlying language patterns and determine which category or categories the text will likely belong to based on its internal language representations. This process is akin to how humans can infer the topic or sentiment of a text without having explicit examples or training data. For example, you can provide prompts like: Classify this list into two groups: mammal and non-mammal <list of animals>.\n\nHowever, it\u2019s important to note that ChatGPT\u2019s performance in classification without examples can be affected by the quality and diversity of the data it has been trained on. If the training data is biased or limited in some way, this can impact ChatGPT\u2019s ability to generalize to new texts and accurately classify them. As such, it\u2019s important to carefully evaluate and monitor the performance of AI language models like ChatGPT in real-world applications.\n\nChatGPT use case 3: Programming assistance\nThere are several code-based use cases where ChatGPT can bring a revolutionary change in terms of software development. Here are some of them:\n\nCode conversion\nBeing an LLM, GPT-3 has no specific feature for transforming code from one programming language to another. However, you can use alternative approaches to perform this task, leveraging AI and natural language processing (NLP) techniques of ChatGPT.\n\nFor example, machine translation techniques can convert code written in one programming language into another, similar to natural language translation text conversion. Let\u2019s say using a prompt like \u2018Convert JavaScript expressions into Python,\u2019 you can convert code written in JavaScript into Python. In this case, ChatGPT\u2019s machine translation systems typically rely on large parallel corpora of source and target language texts to learn the relationships between the two languages.\n\nAnother approach is using code analysis and transformation tools that can automatically parse and manipulate code written in different programming languages by identifying common patterns and structures in the code and mapping them to equivalent constructs in the target language. NLP techniques such as entity recognition and semantic analysis are also used to identify and extract key concepts and relationships in code, guiding the transformation process.\n\nCode translation\nChatGPT has been trained on vast amounts of textual data, including source code written in various programming languages. At the same time, it can use its internal representations of language to explain code in a coherent natural language. To explain simple code, ChatGPT can identify the key components and operations of the code and generate a natural language description that summarizes its functionality. For example, given a simple Python code that calculates the sum of two numbers, ChatGPT could generate a description like: \u201cThis code adds two numbers together and returns their sum. It takes two variables, adds them together using the \u2018+\u2019 operator, and returns the result.\u201d\n\nChatGPT uses its understanding of programming concepts and syntax for complex code to provide a more detailed explanation. Utilizing its human-like perception, it can break down the code into its constituent parts,", "doc_id": "633570a9-2647-4630-aa5d-017c51bcb8a1", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "947dd50d5eb46c9d69dae1433a83a880af6a0846402e0b3b4b1461ba1693c5e0", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 136682, "end": 153398}, "relationships": {"1": "d9152908-bd15-4715-85df-a4e7536a87b3", "2": "78f6d5e4-d61a-4d60-b6ed-68d2bd10576b", "3": "4ca41efd-0a02-4625-9f6b-4b5648150806"}, "__type__": "1"}, "4ca41efd-0a02-4625-9f6b-4b5648150806": {"text": "source code written in various programming languages.

It takes two variables, adds them together using the \u2018+\u2019 operator, and returns the result.\u201d\n\nChatGPT uses its understanding of programming concepts and syntax for complex code to provide a more detailed explanation. Utilizing its human-like perception, it can break down the code into its constituent parts, identify the functions and variables involved, and explain how they interact with each other to achieve a specific outcome. Also, with its natural language generation capability, ChatGPT provides examples or analogies that help illustrate the code\u2019s functionality. For example, if you ask description of a complex Java program that implements a sorting algorithm, ChatGPT could generate a response like: \u201cThis code uses a sorting algorithm to arrange a list of items in ascending order. It creates a temporary array to store intermediate results and then iterates over the input list to compare and swap items until they are sorted. This is similar to sorting a deck of cards by comparing and swapping cards until they are in order.\u201d\n\nSimilarly, you can transform the code\u2019s functionality in another programming language.\n\nCode compression\nChatGPT helps reduce the number of lines of code by identifying redundant or unnecessary code and suggesting ways to remove it. For example, if the code contains multiple loops or conditions that perform similar operations, ChatGPT could suggest consolidating them into a single loop or conditional statement to reduce the overall number of lines of code.

Furthermore, a recent report by McKinsey Global Institute estimates that AI could deliver an additional global economic output of $13 trillion by 2030- showing a remarkable growth trajectory that highlights the immense potential of AI to transform the world and create unprecedented opportunities for economic growth and development. The speedy pace of AI development is bringing us closer to realizing ambitious goals like creating systems capable of performing all human tasks. While progress has historically been gradual and specific to certain tasks, the introduction of the Transformer in 2017 has dramatically accelerated the pace of advancement.\n\nThe Transformer architecture has enabled the development of powerful AI models that can perform a wide range of tasks when combined with large amounts of data and computing resources. For example, GPT-3 can generate all kinds of text-based content like poetry or email responses, DALL-E can create realistic images from natural language descriptions, Codex can assist in software code development, and BERT is an essential component of Google Search. With these advancements, artificial general intelligence (AGI) has become a tangible reality, fulfilling the ultimate goal of AI research.\n\nDespite their impressive capabilities in understanding and generating text and images, current AI models have a major limitation \u2013 they lack the ability to take action in the digital world they operate in. This means that while they can process and analyze vast amounts of data, they cannot actually act upon it.\n\nTo address this limitation, the Action Transformer Model represents a groundbreaking leap in AI development, with the potential to have a tremendous impact on all areas of user activity. This model is designed to enable AI systems not only to understand and generate information but also take meaningful actions based on that information.\n\nThis article discusses the basics of the Action Transformer Model and its implementation details.\n\nWhat are the different types of artificial intelligence?\nWhat is a human-computer interface and what is its role in AI?\nWhat is an Action Transformer Model?\nWhat can you do with an Action Transformer?\nHow does an Action Transformer work?\nHow to implement an Action Transformer?\nA case study on how LeewayHertz integrated the Action Transformer model\nWhat are the different types of artificial intelligence?\nArtificial intelligence is a fascinating field of computer science that aims to create machines that can replicate or even surpass human intelligence. By programming AI systems to perform tasks that usually require human intelligence, we can free ourselves from tedious and repetitive tasks and focus on other vital areas of work. AI systems can learn, reason, solve problems, and make decisions as humans do. And behind every AI system lies a set of powerful algorithms, such as machine learning, deep learning, and rule-based systems. Machine learning algorithms are fed with data, which then use statistical techniques to learn and improve their performance over time. As a result, AI systems become increasingly proficient at specific tasks without the need for explicit programming.\n\nAI technologies are categorized by their ability to mimic human traits, their technology, real-world applications, and the theory of mind. We can classify all AI systems, whether existing or hypothetical, into one of these three types.\n\nWhat are the different types of artificial intelligence\nArtificial Narrow Intelligence (ANI) has a narrow range of abilities and can perform a specific task exceptionally well.\nArtificial General Intelligence (AGI) is on par with human capabilities and can perform a wide range of tasks that require human intelligence.\nArtificial Superintelligence (ASI) is more capable than a human, making it a powerful tool that can transform various industries and revolutionize the tech world.\nLet\u2019s have an overview of these three types of AI.\n\nArtificial Narrow Intelligence (ANI) / Weak AI / Narrow AI\nArtificial Narrow Intelligence (ANI), also known as weak or narrow AI, is the only type of AI that we have successfully realized so far. Unlike the human brain, which can perform various complex tasks, ANI is designed to perform singular tasks with high intelligence and accuracy. Examples of ANI include facial recognition, speech recognition and internet searches. Although ANI may seem intelligent, it operates within a narrow set of constraints and limitations, hence the term weak AI. It doesn\u2019t replicate or mimic human intelligence but simulates human behavior based on specific parameters and contexts.\n\nThe breakthroughs in ANI in the last decade are driven by advancements in machine learning and deep learning. These systems are used in medicine to accurately diagnose diseases like cancer and replicate human-like cognition and reasoning. ANI\u2019s machine intelligence is powered by natural language processing (NLP), which enables it to understand speech and text in natural language and interact with humans in a personalized and natural manner. Chatbots and virtual assistants are examples of ANI technologies that use NLP to personalize interactions. ANI can either be reactive or have limited memory. Reactive AI can respond to different stimuli without prior experience, while limited memory AI is more advanced, using historical data to inform decisions. Most ANI uses limited memory AI and deep learning to personalize experiences like virtual assistants and search engines that store user data.\n\nWhile ANI may seem limited in scope, it has demonstrated remarkable intelligence and accuracy in specific tasks. With advancements in machine learning and NLP, ANI is becoming more personalized and natural in its human interactions. ANI represents the first step in the journey towards more advanced AI and a world transformed by intelligent machines.\n\nExamples of Artificial Narrow Intelligence (ANI) include Siri by Apple, Alexa by Amazon, Cortana by Microsoft, and other virtual assistants. ANI is also utilized by IBM\u2019s Watson, image and facial recognition software, disease mapping and prediction tools, manufacturing and drone robots, email spam filters, social media monitoring tools for objectionable content, entertainment or marketing content recommendations based on watching/listening/purchase behavior, and even self-driving cars. These ANI systems excel at performing specific tasks with high accuracy and intelligence, but their abilities are limited to their programming and cannot replicate or mimic human intelligence.\n\nArtificial General Intelligence (AGI) / Strong AI / Deep AI\nArtificial General Intelligence (AGI) is another major AI research area scientists are focused on. AGI is also referred to as strong AI or deep AI and would enable machines to learn and apply their intelligence to solve any problem just as efficiently as humans can. Put simply, it can allow machines to replicate human intelligence and behaviors. However, achieving AGI is an enormous challenge, as it requires machines to possess a full set of cognitive abilities and the ability to understand human needs, emotions, beliefs, and thought processes. This is a significant step beyond narrow AI, which is limited to performing specific tasks within a narrow set of parameters.\n\nThe theory of mind AI framework, which is the ability of the human mind to attribute mental states to others, is a key component of hot cognition and is used in strong AI research to develop machines that can truly understand humans. The challenge in achieving this level of AI is that the human brain is the model for creating general intelligence, and researchers still have much to learn about how the brain works. Despite these challenges, there have been notable attempts at achieving strong AI, such as the Fujitsu-built K supercomputer. However, the human brain\u2019s complexity means it is difficult to predict when or if strong AI will be achieved. Advances in image and facial recognition technology offer hope for the future of AGI research. As machines become better at seeing and learning, we may see significant progress toward achieving the ultimate goal of creating machines with the same level of intelligence and understanding as humans.\n\nArtificial Super Intelligence (ASI)\nArtificial Super Intelligence (ASI) is the ultimate goal of AI research and development, surpassing human intelligence and the capacity for self-awareness and creativity. ASI machines would be able to understand human emotions and experiences and have their own desires, beliefs and emotions.\n\nUnlike Artificial Narrow Intelligence (ANI) or Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), ASI would be far superior to humans in every way, not only in areas such as maths, science and medicine but also in emotional relationships, sports, art, hobbies and other domains. This is because ASI would have an unprecedented capacity to process and analyze data and stimuli with significantly greater memory.\n\nHowever, the idea of self-aware super-intelligent beings raises significant concerns, as they would have the potential to surpass human intelligence, leading to consequences that are still unknown. If ASI machines were to become self-aware, they would have the ability to think and act independently, potentially leading to ideas such as self-preservation. The impact of such a development on humanity and our way of life is unclear and has sparked debates on the potential benefits and risks of pursuing ASI research.\n\nWhat is a human-computer interface and what is its role in AI?\nWhat is a human-computer interface and what is its role in AI\nHuman-computer interface (HCI), also known as user interface (UI), refers to the point of interaction between a human user and a computer system. It encompasses all aspects of how humans interact with computers, including hardware design, software design, and the usability of computer systems. There are several types of human-computer interfaces, including graphical user interfaces (GUIs), command-line interfaces (CLIs), and natural language interfaces (NLIs). Each of these interfaces has its own strengths and weaknesses, and the choice of interface depends on the specific application and the users\u2019 needs.\n\nAmong all these, NLI is used in AI applications, which allow users to interact with computers or other electronic devices using natural languages, such as spoken language or typed text. NLIs are becoming increasingly popular due to advances in natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning (ML) technologies. The goal of NLIs is to make human-computer interaction more intuitive and user-friendly. Rather than requiring users to learn specific commands or navigate complex menus, NLIs allow users to communicate with computers more naturally and conversationally, which becomes especially useful for users who are not technically proficient or have limited mobility.\n\nNLIs can be implemented in various ways, including chatbots, voice assistants, and text-based interfaces. Chatbots are computer programs that simulate human conversation, typically using text-based interfaces. Voice assistants like Amazon\u2019s Alexa and Apple\u2019s Siri use speech recognition technology to interpret spoken commands and provide responses. Text-based interfaces like those used in search engines and virtual assistants allow users to type in natural language queries and receive responses.\n\nOne of the key challenges in designing NLIs is ensuring that the system can accurately interpret and respond to user input. This requires sophisticated natural language processing algorithms that can understand the nuances of language and respond appropriately. NLP techniques, such as named entity recognition, part-of-speech tagging, and sentiment analysis, are often used to extract meaning from user input. Another challenge in designing NLIs is maintaining user engagement and avoiding frustration. NLIs must be able to respond quickly and accurately to user queries and provide useful and relevant information. This requires careful design of the system\u2019s user interface and sophisticated machine learning algorithms that can learn from user interactions and adapt to their preferences over time.\n\nWhat is an Action Transformer Model?\nThe Action Transformer Model represents a groundbreaking technological advancement that enables seamless communication with other software and applications, effectively bridging humanity and the digital realm. It is based on a large transformer model and operates as a natural human-computer interface, much like Google\u2019s PSC, allowing users to issue high-level commands in natural language and watch as the program performs complex tasks across various software and websites. The ability of Action Transformers to process user feedback and continuously improve their performance makes them even more remarkable.\n\nBut what truly sets Action Transformers apart is their capacity to accomplish tasks that would otherwise be impossible for humans to perform. With their multitasking meta-learner capabilities, they can handle all sorts of software applications, making the need to learn Excel, Photoshop, or Salesforce obsolete. Instead, users can delegate these mundane tasks to the Action Transformer and focus on more intellectually challenging problems.\n\nOf course, for Action Transformers to be effective, they must work flawlessly. If not, how can we trust them to accomplish tasks we lack the ability or knowledge to perform? Additionally, communicating with the model is crucial for success, highlighting the importance of prompting and clear instructions in the future of digital technology. Overall, the Action Transformer Model represents a significant step forward in human-computer interaction, offering unparalleled possibilities for innovation and progress.\n\nTechnically, the Action Transformer Model is an advanced artificial intelligence technology designed to serve as a natural human-computer interface (HCI) and enable seamless communication with other programs and applications. It allows users to issue", "doc_id": "76417661-ef4b-46f9-b739-e86dead746da", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "6f3011a0c20b98ff4283e14e7ab608c50e3888cafae3f3bb5aa51b7bdf9be8a8", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 169787, "end": 186187}, "relationships": {"1": "d9152908-bd15-4715-85df-a4e7536a87b3", "2": "4ca41efd-0a02-4625-9f6b-4b5648150806", "3": "f0ebdd54-be6e-42c6-9506-61552a6cefa8"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f0ebdd54-be6e-42c6-9506-61552a6cefa8": {"text": "or Salesforce obsolete. Instead, users can delegate these mundane tasks to the Action Transformer and focus on more intellectually challenging problems.\n\nOf course, for Action Transformers to be effective, they must work flawlessly.

Additionally, communicating with the model is crucial for success, highlighting the importance of prompting and clear instructions in the future of digital technology. Overall, the Action Transformer Model represents a significant step forward in human-computer interaction, offering unparalleled possibilities for innovation and progress.\n\nTechnically, the Action Transformer Model is an advanced artificial intelligence technology designed to serve as a natural human-computer interface (HCI) and enable seamless communication with other programs and applications. It allows users to issue high-level commands in natural language, which the program can then execute across various software tools and websites. The model is capable of handling tasks involving multiple steps and different software applications, making it a highly versatile tool. Additionally, the Action Transformer Model can learn from user feedback and continuously improve its performance, making it an increasingly valuable resource over time. Its ability to perform tasks that would be impossible for humans to accomplish is what sets it apart from other digital technologies. Overall, the Action Transformer Model represents a significant step forward in human-computer interaction and offers exciting possibilities for innovation and progress. The Action Transformer works by breaking down the user\u2019s command into a series of smaller actions or steps that need to be performed. These steps are then translated into a sequence of API calls or other actions the system can execute. The tool uses a combination of pre-built workflows and custom logic to ensure that the actions it performs are accurate and complete.\n\nWhat can you do with an Action Transformer?\nExecuting user requests\nThe Action Transformer Model is a groundbreaking artificial intelligence technology capable of performing a variety of tasks by communicating with different software tools. The model has been trained to understand natural language commands and can use its knowledge of different software applications to carry out complex tasks on behalf of the user by executing the necessary steps to complete the task. For example, if users want to create a spreadsheet that summarizes their monthly expenses, they need to type in a command such as \u201cCreate a spreadsheet summarizing my expenses for the month.\u201d Action Transformer would then use its knowledge of spreadsheet software, such as Microsoft Excel or Google Sheets, to create the necessary spreadsheet and populate it with the relevant data.\n\nSimilarly, if a user wants to resize and crop a photo, they could type in a command such as \u201cResize and crop this photo\u201d as a prompt. Action Transformer would use its understanding of photo editing software, such as Adobe Photoshop or GIMP, to execute the necessary steps to achieve the desired result.\n\nPerforming complex tasks\nAction Transformer enables users to perform complex tasks by simply providing a natural language command. Using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning (ML) algorithms, Action Transformers understand the user\u2019s command and translate it into a series of actions that a computer can execute sequentially to accomplish the task. For example, instead of clicking through multiple screens and menus to create a new contact in Salesforce, a user can type \u201cCreate a new contact for John Smith,\u201d and the Action Transformer will execute the necessary steps to create the contact in the system.\n\nWorking in-depth on tools like spreadsheet\nAction Transformers can automate tasks in various applications, including spreadsheets, which include a wide range of tasks, from simple calculations to complex data analysis. For example, instead of manually calculating the sum of a column of numbers in a spreadsheet, a user can type \u201csum column A,\u201d and the Action Transformer will execute the necessary steps to perform the calculation. In this case, the Action Transformer breaks down the user\u2019s command into a series of smaller actions or steps that need to be performed sequentially. The model then translates it into a sequence of API calls or other actions the system can execute. Also, the tool uses a combination of pre-built workflows and custom logic, ensuring that the actions it performs are accurate and complete.\n\nSimilarly, you can format, sort, filter, and perform calculations using Action Transformers in spreadsheets, saving time and increasing productivity. Besides, it can also help users perform tasks they may not know how to do themselves, such as performing complex statistical analyses or building interactive dashboards. Similarly, it can infer what the user means from context. For example, if a user types \u201caverage of the sales column,\u201d the Action Transformer can infer that they want to calculate the average of the values in the column labeled \u201csales.\u201d This ability to understand the context and infer user intent can help users perform tasks more quickly and accurately.\n\nComposing multiple tools together\nAction Transformer is capable of completing tasks that require composing multiple tools together. Most things we do on a computer span multiple programs, and the Action Transformer is designed to work seamlessly across multiple applications to complete complex tasks. For example, suppose a user wants to create a report that combines data from a spreadsheet, a database, and an analytics tool. Instead of manually copying and pasting data between multiple applications, the user can provide a natural language command to Action Transformer, such as \u201ccreate a report that combines sales data from the spreadsheet with customer data from the database and visualizes it using the analytics tool.\u201d\n\nAction Transformer will then break down the command into a series of smaller actions and execute them across the various applications. It may use APIs, command-line tools, or other mechanisms to interact with these applications and extract the necessary data. One of the strengths of the Action Transformer is its ability to understand user intent and ask for clarifications when necessary. For example, if the user\u2019s command is ambiguous or incomplete, the Action Transformer may prompt the user for additional information to ensure it can complete the task correctly, ensuring the final output is accurate and meets the user\u2019s expectations.\n\nIn the future, we can expect Action Transformers to become even more helpful by leveraging advanced NLP and ML techniques. For example, it may be able to use context and previous user interactions to anticipate the user\u2019s needs and provide suggestions or recommendations. Additionally, it may be able to learn from user feedback and adapt its behavior over time to meet the needs of individual users better.\n\nSearching information online through voice input\nAction Transformers can use a variety of techniques to look up information online, even when using voice input mode. Let\u2019s say when a user provides a voice command to a tool using an Action Transformer, the model first converts the audio input into text using speech recognition algorithms and then uses NLP techniques to extract the relevant keywords and entities from the text, such as a person\u2019s name or a specific piece of information that the user is looking for. Once the keywords and entities have been identified, the Action Transformer can use a variety of methods to look up information online. For example, it may use search engines, databases, APIs, or other online resources to retrieve the information that the user needs. Using pre-built workflows or custom logic, it ensures that the information it retrieves is accurate and relevant to the user\u2019s needs.\n\nIncorporating feedback\nAction Transformer is designed to be highly coachable, meaning that it can learn from human feedback and become more useful with each interaction which is possible because the tool is built on machine learning (ML) algorithms that can adapt and improve over time as they receive more data. When an Action Transformer makes a mistake, it can be corrected with a single piece of human feedback. For example, if the tool misinterprets a user\u2019s command or fails to complete a task correctly, the user can provide feedback to indicate where the mistake occurred and how it can be corrected.\n\nThe ML algorithms that power the Action Transformers can then use this feedback to adjust and improve the tool\u2019s performance. The algorithms can identify patterns and learn from past mistakes by analyzing the feedback and comparing it to previous interactions. This makes the tool more accurate and reliable over time, ultimately making it more useful to the user.\n\nOne of the key advantages of this coachable approach is that it allows Action Transformer to adapt to individual users\u2019 needs and preferences. As the tool learns from each interaction, it can adjust its behavior to meet the user\u2019s needs better, making it more efficient and effective in completing tasks.\n\nHow does an Action Transformer work?\nAction Transformer is a large-scale transformer model that uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning (ML) algorithms to understand and execute user commands. Here\u2019s a detailed overview of how it works:\n\nHow does an Action Transformer work\nInput processing\nInput processing is a critical step in the workflow of an Action Transformer that involves analyzing and understanding the input provided by the user. Action Transformer is designed to process input in various forms, including text, voice, and structured data. For text input, the Action Transformer uses natural language processing (NLP) techniques to parse the input and extract relevant information, breaking down the input into individual words and analyzing the sentence\u2019s grammatical structure to determine the meaning.\n\nAction Transformer employs automatic speech recognition (ASR) techniques to convert the user\u2019s spoken words into text when processing voice input. It then applies NLP techniques to analyze the text and understand the user\u2019s intent.\n\nFor structured data input, the Action Transformer uses techniques such as data normalization and schema mapping to extract relevant information from the input and convert it into a format that the system can process. After processing the input, the Action Transformer applies its machine learning algorithms to generate an appropriate response or take action based on the user\u2019s intent. The response may be in the form of text, voice, or a series of actions performed by the system.\n\nIntent recognition\nIntent recognition is a critical component of how an Action Transformer works. It involves identifying the user\u2019s intent based on the input provided, such as a text or voice command. Here are the technical details on how the Action Transformer performs intent recognition.\n\nThe first step in intent recognition is preprocessing the input. This involves tokenizing the input into individual words, removing stop words, and stemming the words to their root form. After preprocessing, features are extracted from the input. This includes bag-of-words representations, which represent the frequency of each word in the input, as well as n-grams, which represent the frequency of combinations of words. The features are then used to classify the intent of the input. Action Transformer uses machine learning models, such as logistic regression, support vector machines (SVMs), and neural networks, to classify the input into different intent categories. Before classification, the machine learning model must be trained on a dataset of labeled examples. This dataset consists of input examples and their corresponding intent labels. As the Action Transformer receives new inputs and interactions, it can continuously improve its intent recognition capabilities by incorporating these new examples into its training data.\n\nOverall, intent recognition in an Action Transformer involves preprocessing the input, extracting relevant features, classifying the intent using machine learning models, training the model on labeled examples, and continuously learning from new data. By performing these steps, the Action Transformer can accurately identify the user\u2019s intent and generate appropriate responses or take action accordingly.\n\nAction generation\nAfter the Action Transformer Model has identified the intent of the user\u2019s request, it generates a sequence of actions required to fulfill that request which can be broken down into several steps.\n\nThe model generates actions in two stages: instruction generation and code generation.\n\nInstruction generation: In this stage, the model generates high-level instructions for the program, such as the steps needed to achieve a specific task. The model inputs a description of the task, such as natural language text, and generates a sequence of instructions describing how to accomplish the task. For example, given the task of sorting a list of numbers, the model might generate instructions like \u201cinitialize a list variable,\u201d \u201cloop through the list,\u201d and \u201cswap the values of two elements if they are in the wrong order.\u201d\nCode generation: In the next stage, the model generates actual code based on the instructions generated in the first stage. The model inputs the instructions generated in the first stage sequentially and generates a sequence of tokens representing the program code. The generated code is typically in a low-level programming language like Python or Java. For example, given the instructions generated in the first stage for sorting a list of numbers, the model might generate Python code that implements the sorting algorithm described by the instructions.\nExecution\nAfter generating a sequence of actions to fulfill the user\u2019s request, the Action Transformer Model executes those actions on behalf of the user using an automation framework and by interacting with various software tools and applications, such as spreadsheets, databases, or APIs, by sending commands and receiving data in return. Furthermore, the execution process involves automating repetitive tasks, retrieving information from various sources, or performing complex calculations or analyses.\n\nFor example, if the user requests the model to extract data from a spreadsheet and perform some calculations on it, the model would first generate a sequence of actions to open the spreadsheet, extract the relevant data, perform the calculations, and then save the results. The model would generate code to execute these actions appropriately, with each step building on the previous one till the task is complete.\n\nFeedback and learning\nThe feedback and learning mechanisms in the Action Transformer Model allow it to improve and adapt to the user\u2019s needs continuously, making it an effective tool for automating tasks and simplifying complex workflows, which in turn helps improve its performance, making each interaction more useful and accurate. To accomplish this, the model collects feedback throughout the process, such as corrections to mistakes, suggestions for improvements, or requests for additional functionality.\n\nWhen the user provides feedback, the Action Transformer Model adapts and learns from it. For example, if the model makes a mistake, the user can correct it, and the model will adjust its actions accordingly. Similarly, if the user suggests a better task performance, the model can incorporate that information into its future actions. The model also uses reinforcement learning to improve its performance by learning to identify which actions are most effective in achieving the user\u2019s goal, involving a process of trial and error, where the model tries different actions and evaluates their effectiveness based on feedback from the user.\n\nSecurity and privacy\nAction Transformer takes several measures to ensure the security and privacy of user data. The model encrypts sensitive data, such as user inputs and outputs, to protect it from unauthorized access. Additionally, access controls are in place to restrict access to user data to only those individuals who require it to perform their tasks. Action Transformer also regularly conducts security audits to identify potential vulnerabilities in the system and takes prompt action to address them, mitigating the risk of data breaches and other security incidents.\n\nFurthermore, the model adheres to relevant data privacy regulations, such as GDPR and CCPA, to protect user privacy. This includes obtaining user consent for data collection and processing, providing users with access to their data, and allowing users to request the deletion of their data.\n\nHow to implement an Action Transformer?\nAn Action Transformer Model is a type of machine learning model used to predict actions based on a certain input or context. It is often used in Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks, such as machine translation, question answering, and dialogue generation, where the input sequence is first encoded into a fixed-size vector representation, and then the decoder generates the output sequence one token at a time,", "doc_id": "f0ebdd54-be6e-42c6-9506-61552a6cefa8", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "78a7914a0edc73ca38b4f1517bab5fdb13eb533327cf9bc1f59a0627e01adfe7", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 186096, "end": 203483}, "relationships": {"1": "d9152908-bd15-4715-85df-a4e7536a87b3", "2": "76417661-ef4b-46f9-b739-e86dead746da", "3": "3b0391e3-1ff5-4367-b416-c45ce5af6c6e"}, "__type__": "1"}, "3b0391e3-1ff5-4367-b416-c45ce5af6c6e": {"text": "potential vulnerabilities in the system and takes prompt action to address them, mitigating the risk of data breaches and other security incidents.\n\nFurthermore, the model adheres to relevant data privacy regulations, such as GDPR and CCPA, to protect user privacy. This includes obtaining user consent for data collection and processing, providing users with access to their data, and allowing users to request the deletion of their data.\n\nHow to implement an Action Transformer?\nAn Action Transformer Model is a type of machine learning model used to predict actions based on a certain input or context. It is often used in Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks, such as machine translation, question answering, and dialogue generation, where the input sequence is first encoded into a fixed-size vector representation, and then the decoder generates the output sequence one token at a time, conditioned on the previously generated tokens and the encoded input.\n\nHere are the general steps to implement an Action Transformer Model:\n\nHow to implement an Action Transformer\nData preparation\nA crucial aspect of constructing an Action Transformer Model is preparing the data appropriately. The model requires data input in a specific format to operate accurately. The first step involves cleaning the data by eliminating irrelevant characters, symbols, and formatting, such as punctuation, special characters, and non-alphanumeric characters that do not contribute to the text\u2019s meaning. Subsequently, duplicative or irrelevant data must be removed.\n\nAfterward, the data is tokenized by breaking the text into smaller chunks, such as words or subwords, which is crucial since the model processes text as a sequence of tokens. Several libraries, such as the Python NLTK library, are available to tokenize text. Next, the tokens are converted into numerical representations that the model can process, typically by creating a unique token dictionary and assigning a unique index to each token. Each token sequence is then mapped to a sequence of numerical indices, which may have different lengths and can cause issues during model training. Padding can be added to the end of shorter sequences to make them the same length as longer sequences, and if a sequence is too long, it can be truncated to a specified length, ensuring that all input sequences have the same length.\n\nFinally, the data is split into training, validation, and test sets, with the training set used to train the model, the validation set used to tune the hyperparameters, and the test set used to evaluate the model\u2019s performance on new data. To improve the model\u2019s performance and increase the training data size, data augmentation techniques such as random deletion, insertion, or replacement of words or phrases can be applied.\n\nBuild the model architecture\nBuilding the model architecture of an Action Transformer Model involves defining the layers and parameters of the model. Several layers come into the picture. First, you need to build the input layer of the model that takes the numerical sequence of tokens as input. The input layer is typically an embedding layer that maps each token to a high-dimensional vector space. Next comes the encoding layer, consisting of a stack of transformer encoder layers that encode the input sequence into a fixed-size vector representation. Each encoder layer consists of a multi-head self-attention mechanism and feedforward neural network, followed by residual connections and layer normalization. To decode the information, the decoding layer consists of a stack of transformer decoder layers that generate the output sequence one token at a time, conditioned on the previously generated tokens and the encoded input. Each decoder layer consists of a multi-head self-attention mechanism, a multi-head attention mechanism with encoder output, a feedforward neural network, residual connections and layer normalization. Finally comes the output layer that takes the final hidden state of the decoder and predicts the probability distribution over the output vocabulary. The output layer is typically a softmax layer that computes the probabilities of the tokens in the output vocabulary.\n\nSetting the hyperparameters is another crucial part that includes the number of encoder and decoder layers, the number of heads in the multi-head attention mechanism, the size of the hidden layers, the learning rate, the batch size, the dropout rate, and the number of epochs. These hyperparameters are usually determined by trial and error on a validation set to find the optimal configuration that minimizes the loss function.\n\nHere are some additional tips on building the architecture of an Action Transformer Model:\n\nUsing pre-trained embeddings can improve the performance of the model.\nAdding positional encodings to the input embeddings can help the model to understand the order of the input sequence.\nUsing layer normalization and residual connections can help to prevent vanishing gradients during training and improve the model\u2019s performance.\nUsing a beam search decoding algorithm can improve the quality of the generated output sequences.\nTrain the model\nTraining an Action Transformer Model involves feeding the pre-processed input data through the model, computing the loss function, and adjusting the model\u2019s parameters to minimize the loss function. Several steps are performed to train an Action Transformer Model, as described below.\n\nThe training loop involves iterating over the training data for a fixed number of epochs. In each epoch, the model is trained on batches of data, where each batch contains a fixed number of input sequences and their corresponding output sequences. The batch size determines the number of batches per epoch, which is a hyperparameter of the model.\nCompute the loss function: The loss function measures the difference between predicted and true output sequences. The cross-entropy loss function is the most commonly used for sequence-to-sequence models. The loss function is computed for each batch of data, and the average loss across all batches is used to measure the model\u2019s performance.\nBackpropagation and Gradient Descent: The backpropagation algorithm is used to compute the gradients of the loss function with respect to the model\u2019s parameters. The gradients are then used to update the model\u2019s parameters using the Gradient Descent algorithm. The learning rate is a hyperparameter that determines the step size for each update and can be adjusted during training to improve the model\u2019s performance.\nEvaluate the model on the validation set: After each epoch, the model is evaluated on the validation set to measure its performance on unseen data, which involves computing the loss function and any other relevant metrics, such as accuracy or F1 score.\nEarly stopping: Early stopping is a technique used to prevent overfitting by stopping training when the model\u2019s performance on the validation set stops improving. This is typically determined by monitoring the validation loss over several epochs and stopping training when the validation loss starts to increase.\nTest the model: After the training is complete, the model is evaluated on the test set to measure its performance on unseen data. This involves computing the loss function and any other relevant metrics, such as accuracy or F1 score.\nModel evaluation\nAfter an Action Transformer Model is trained, evaluating its performance on a held-out test set is important. Several metrics are used to evaluate the performance of an Action Transformer Model:\n\nLoss Function: The loss function measures the difference between predicted and true output sequences. The lower the loss function, the better the model\u2019s performance.\nAccuracy: Accuracy measures the proportion of correctly predicted output tokens in the test set. It is calculated as the number of correct predictions divided by the total number of predictions.\nF1 score: F1 score is a weighted average of precision and recall. Precision is the proportion of true positive predictions among all positive predictions, and recall is the proportion of true positive predictions among all true instances of the positive class. The F1 score measures the model\u2019s overall performance, balancing precision and recall.\nPerplexity: Perplexity measures how well the model predicts the test set. It is calculated as 2^H, where H is the entropy of the model\u2019s predictions on the test set. The lower the perplexity, the better the model\u2019s performance.\nBleu score: Bleu score measures the similarity between the model\u2019s predicted output sequence and the true output sequence. It is calculated as a weighted combination of n-gram matches between the predicted and true sequences.\nHuman evaluation: In addition to automated metrics, it is important to evaluate the model\u2019s output. This involves having human evaluators rate the quality of the model\u2019s output sequences based on fluency, relevance, and coherence criteria.\nOverall, the choice of evaluation metrics depends on the specific task and goals of the Action Transformer Model. Combining automated metrics and human evaluation can provide a more comprehensive understanding of the model\u2019s performance.\n\nTuning hyperparameters\nHyperparameter tuning can be time-consuming but critical for achieving the best performance out of an Action Transformer Model. The choice of hyperparameters can depend on the specific problem domain, and the search strategy should be tailored to the size of the hyperparameter space and the available computational resources.\n\nThe first step in hyperparameter tuning is to define the range of values for each hyperparameter which can be done based on prior knowledge of the problem domain or by using a range of values commonly used in the literature. The next step is defining the search strategy. Several search strategies can be used for hyperparameter tuning, including grid search, random search, and Bayesian optimization. Grid search involves exhaustively searching over all possible combinations of hyperparameters within the defined range, while random search involves randomly sampling hyperparameters within the defined range. Bayesian optimization uses a probabilistic model to iteratively explore the hyperparameter space and identify the most promising regions to search.\n\nTo evaluate the model\u2019s performance for different hyperparameter settings, it is important to set up a separate validation scheme from the test set. This can be done using k-fold cross-validation or by setting aside a separate validation set. Next, for each combination of hyperparameters, you need to train the model on the training set and evaluate its performance on the validation set. This involves setting up the training loop, computing the loss function, performing backpropagation and Gradient Descent to update the model\u2019s parameters, and evaluating the model on the validation set.\n\nSelect the hyperparameters that result in the best performance based on the model\u2019s performance on the validation set. This involves comparing the performance metrics, such as accuracy or F1 score, for each combination of hyperparameters. Once the best hyperparameters have been selected, train the final model on the combined training and validation set, and evaluate its performance on the test set.\n\nUse the model for prediction\nThe Action Transformer Model uses a combination of self-attention and feedforward networks to encode the input sequence and then generates the output sequence one token at a time, conditioned on the previously generated tokens and the encoded input. This process allows the model to capture complex patterns in the input sequence and generate coherent output sequences.\n\nThe first step in making a prediction is to encode the input sequence using the encoder of the trained model. This involves passing the input sequence through several layers of self-attention and feedforward networks, resulting in a context vector that summarizes the input sequence. Once the input sequence is encoded, the decoder of the model generates the output sequence one token at a time. The decoder takes the encoded input sequence as well as the previously generated tokens as input and produces a probability distribution over the vocabulary of possible output tokens. The token with the highest probability is selected as the next output token. At each step of the decoding process, the decoder is conditioned on the previously generated tokens, which means that the decoder considers the context of the previously generated tokens to generate the next token. This allows the model to capture long-term dependencies and generate coherent output sequences. The process of generating tokens continues iteratively until a special end-of-sequence token is generated or a maximum sequence length is reached. The output sequence can then be returned as the prediction of the model.\n\nSome additional tips for implementing an Action Transformer Model include:\n\nPre-training the model on a large dataset before fine-tuning it on a specific task can improve its performance.\nAttention mechanisms can help the model focus on relevant parts of the input sequence.\nRegularizing the model using dropout or weight decay techniques can prevent overfitting and improve its generalization performance.\nA case study on how LeewayHertz integrated the Action Transformer model\nThe problem\nA manufacturing firm with over 10,000 support tickets in its database and 1000 SKUs is currently encountering difficulties in determining the most valuable support tickets for newly generated leads from its website. To overcome this challenge, the firm is seeking the implementation of an Action Transformer (ACT) model that can analyze the incoming leads and identify the top three support tickets that can assist their sales team in securing deals. Once identified, the ACT model automatically adds these tickets to the CRM.\n\nThe solution\nLeewayHertz has segregated the solution into three distinct steps:\n\nAction Transformer solution\nData collection and pre-processing\nIn the first step, the support ticket data is collected and preprocessed using tokenization, part-of-speech tagging, and entity recognition techniques to extract relevant information. Then, the OpenAI Embeddings API is used to convert each support ticket into a vector representation, which is stored in a database.\n\nLead analysis\nIn the second step, when a new lead is added to the CRM, pertinent information such as product interest, demographics, and lead message is extracted, and a summary is created using LLM. The cosine similarity between the lead\u2019s summary and the support tickets in the database is then calculated to identify the top three support tickets that align with the lead\u2019s product interest.\n\nDigital agent module\nIn the third step, the Digital Agent module generates step-by-step instructions using a fine-tuned LLM on how to add the top three support tickets into the CRM. Another fine-tuned LLM is used to generate code for the steps outlined in the instructions. The Script Execution Framework then uses the code generated to integrate the top three support tickets with the CRM. The framework utilizes pre-written action transformer automation scripts, but custom scripts can also be generated based on the required action items.\n\nEndnote\nWe can imagine being able to communicate with our devices through natural language, eliminating the need for complex graphical user interfaces and extensive training. This is the future that natural language interfaces powered by Action Transformers can bring. With these interfaces, anyone can become a power user regardless of their expertise, making implementing their ideas easier and working more efficiently. We will no longer need to waste time searching for documentation, manuals, or FAQs because models will be able to understand and execute our commands, freeing us to focus on more important tasks. AI-powered Action Transformers will revolutionize breakthroughs in drug design, engineering, and other fields by working with humans as teammates, making us more efficient and creative. This technology shift will bring about more accessible and powerful software, democratizing access to technology and paving the way for greater innovation towards AGI.

In fields such as art and design, generative AI models are being used to create stunning new artworks and designs that push the boundaries of creativity. In medicine, generative AI models for image synthesis are used to generate synthetic medical images for diagnostic and training purposes, allowing doctors to understand complex medical conditions better and improve patient outcomes. In addition, generative AI models for image synthesis are also being used to create more realistic and immersive virtual environments for entertainment and gaming applications. In fact, the ability to generate high-quality, realistic images using generative AI models is causing new possibilities for innovation and creativity to emerge across industries.\nIn this article, we discuss generative AI models for image synthesis, their importance, use cases and more.\n\nWhat are generative AI models?\nUnderstanding image synthesis and its importance\nTypes of generative AI models for image synthesis\nChoosing the right dataset for your model\nPreparing data for training\nBuilding a generative AI model using GANs (Generative Adversarial Networks)\nGenerating new images with your model\nApplications of generative AI models for image synthesis\nWhat are generative AI models?\nGenerative AI models are a class of machine learning algorithms capable of producing fresh content from patterns learned from massive training datasets. These models use deep learning techniques to learn patterns and features from the training data and use that knowledge to create new data samples.\n\nGenerative AI models have a wide range of applications, such as generating images, text, code and even music. One of the most popular types of generative AI models is the Generative Adversarial Network (GAN), which consists of two neural networks: a generator network that creates new data samples and a discriminator network that evaluates whether the generated samples are real or fake.\n\nGenerative AI models have the potential to revolutionize various industries, such as entertainment, art, and fashion, by enabling the creation of novel and unique content quickly.\n\nUnderstanding image synthesis and its importance\nGenerative models are a type of artificial intelligence that can create new images that are similar to the ones they were trained on. This technique is known as image synthesis, and it is achieved through the use of deep learning algorithms that learn patterns and features from a large database of photographs. These models are capable of correcting any missing, blurred or misleading visual elements in the images, resulting in stunning, realistic and high-quality images.\n\nGenerative AI models can even make low-quality pictures appear to have been taken by an expert by increasing their clarity and level of detail. Additionally, AI can merge existing portraits or extract features from any image to create synthetic human faces that look like real people.\n\nThe value of generative AI in image synthesis lies in its ability to generate new, original images that have never been seen before. This has significant implications for various industries, including creative, product design, marketing, and scientific fields, where it can be used to create lifelike models of human anatomy and diseases.\n\nThe most commonly used generative models in image synthesis include variational autoencoder (VAE), autoregressive models, and generative adversarial networks (GANs).\n\nTypes of generative AI models for image synthesis\nImages may be synthesized using a variety of generative AI models, each of which has its own advantages and disadvantages. Here, we will discuss some of the most popular generative AI model types used for picture synthesis.\n\nGenerative Adversarial Networks (GANs)\nGAN, or Generative Adversarial Network, is a popular and effective type of generative AI model used for creating images. GAN consists of two neural networks: a generator network and a discriminator network. The generator network creates new images, while the discriminator network determines if the images created by the generator are real or fake.\n\nDuring the training process, the two networks are trained in parallel, in a technique known as adversarial training. The generator tries to trick the discriminator, while the discriminator tries to distinguish between real and fake images. As a result, the generator learns to create images that are increasingly realistic and difficult for the discriminator to identify as fake.\n\nGANs have demonstrated remarkable success in producing high-quality and realistic images in various applications such as computer vision, video game design, and painting. They are capable of working with complex image structures and producing images with intricate features such as textures and patterns that other models may struggle to depict.\n\nHowever, GANs require significant training to deliver high-quality results, which can be challenging. Despite these difficulties, GANs continue to be a widely used and successful method for image synthesis across various industries.\n\nVariational Autoencoders (VAEs)\nVAE, or Variational Autoencoder, is another type of generative AI model used for picture synthesis. VAEs are networks that consist of an encoder and a decoder. The encoder learns a compressed representation of an input image, also known as latent space, and the decoder uses this compressed representation to generate new images that are identical to the input image.\n\nWhen combined with other methods like adversarial training, VAEs have shown promising outcomes in creating high-quality images. They are capable of generating graphics with intricate features such as textures and patterns, and can manage complicated visuals. Additionally, the encoding and decoding processes used by VAEs have a probabilistic component, which enables them to produce a wide range of new pictures from a single input image.\n\nHowever, unlike GANs, VAEs may have difficulty in producing extremely realistic pictures. They also take longer to produce images since each new image needs to be encoded and decoded. Despite these drawbacks, VAEs continue to be a widely used method for image synthesis and have shown effectiveness in various applications such as computer graphics and medical imaging.\n\nAutoregressive models\nAutoregressive models are a type of generative AI model used for image creation, where the model starts with a seed image and creates new images pixel by pixel. The model predicts the value of the next pixel based on the values of the preceding pixels. While autoregressive models can create high-quality photos with intricate details, they produce new images relatively slowly because each pixel must be generated separately.\n\nDespite this limitation, autoregressive models have demonstrated effectiveness in producing high-quality images with fine details and complex structures, particularly in applications such as picture inpainting and super-resolution. However, compared to GANs, autoregressive models may have difficulty producing extremely realistic images.\n\nDespite these drawbacks, autoregressive models are still a popular technique for image synthesis in a variety of fields, including computer vision, medical imaging, and natural language processing. Additionally, improvements in design and training techniques continue to enhance the performance of autoregressive models for image synthesis.\n\nChoosing the right dataset for your model\nGenerative AI models rely heavily on the dataset they are trained on to generate high-quality, diverse images. To achieve this, the dataset should be large enough to represent the richness and variety of the target picture domain, ensuring that the generative model can learn from a wide range of examples. For example, if the goal is to create medical images, the dataset should contain a diverse range of medical photos capturing various illnesses, organs, and imaging modalities.\n\nIn addition to size and diversity, the dataset should also be properly labeled to ensure that the generative model learns the correct semantic properties of the photos. This means that each image in the dataset should be accurately labeled, indicating the object or scene depicted in the picture. Both manual and automated labeling methods can be used for this purpose.\n\nFinally, the quality of the dataset is also important. It should be free of errors, artifacts, and biases to ensure that the generative model learns accurate and unbiased representations of the picture domain. For instance, if the dataset has biases towards certain objects or features, the generative model may learn to replicate these biases in the generated images.\n\nSelecting the right dataset is critical for the success of generative AI models for image synthesis. A suitable dataset should be large, diverse, properly labeled, and of high quality to ensure that the generative model can learn accurate and unbiased representations of the target picture domain.\n\nPreparing data for training\nPreparing data for training a generative AI model used for image synthesis involves collecting the data, preprocessing it, augmenting it, normalizing it, and splitting it into training, validation, and testing sets. Each step is crucial in ensuring that the model can learn the patterns and features of the data correctly, leading to more accurate image synthesis.\n\nThere are several phases involved in getting data ready for generative AI model training so that the model can accurately learn the patterns and properties of the data.\n\nData collection: This is the initial stage in gathering the data needed to train a generative AI model for picture synthesis. The model\u2019s performance may be significantly impacted by the type and volume of data gathered. The data may be gathered from a variety of places, including web databases, stock picture archives, and commissioned photo or video projects.\n\nData preprocessing: Preprocessing involves a series of operations performed on the raw data to make it usable and understandable by the model. In the context of image data, preprocessing typically involves cleaning, resizing, and formatting the images to a standard that the model can work with.\n\nData augmentation: It involves making various transformations to the original dataset to artificially create additional examples for training the model. It can help expand the range of the data used to train the model. This can be especially important when working with a limited dataset, as it allows the model to learn from a greater variety of examples, which can improve its ability to generalize to new, unseen examples. Data augmentation can help prevent overfitting, a common problem in machine learning. Overfitting occurs when a model becomes too specialized to the training data, to the point that it performs poorly on new, unseen data.\n\nData normalization: Data normalization, entails scaling the pixel values to a predetermined range, often between 0 and 1. Normalization helps to avoid overfitting by ensuring that the model can learn the patterns and characteristics of the data more quickly.\n\nDividing the data: Training, validation, and testing sets are created from the data. The validation set is used to fine-tune the model\u2019s hyperparameters, the testing set is used to assess the model\u2019s performance, and the training set is used to train the model. Depending on the size of the dataset, the splitting ratio can change, but a typical split is 70% training, 15% validation, and 15% testing.\n\nBuilding a generative AI model using GANs (Generative Adversarial Networks)\nCreating a generative AI model for image synthesis using GAN entails carefully gathering and preprocessing the", "doc_id": "b597c56d-ee4e-4d3b-899a-ff11977766ea", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "2ac051af22aaaccc6d469e9b00ba16f57df937ba77d498fd65bf9aa01c97d623", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 220536, "end": 236685}, "relationships": {"1": "d9152908-bd15-4715-85df-a4e7536a87b3", "2": "3b0391e3-1ff5-4367-b416-c45ce5af6c6e", "3": "da9ff061-8944-4071-8577-a04015978d2e"}, "__type__": "1"}, "da9ff061-8944-4071-8577-a04015978d2e": {"text": "normalization, entails scaling the pixel values to a predetermined range, often between 0 and 1.

The validation set is used to fine-tune the model\u2019s hyperparameters, the testing set is used to assess the model\u2019s performance, and the training set is used to train the model. Depending on the size of the dataset, the splitting ratio can change, but a typical split is 70% training, 15% validation, and 15% testing.\n\nBuilding a generative AI model using GANs (Generative Adversarial Networks)\nCreating a generative AI model for image synthesis using GAN entails carefully gathering and preprocessing the data, defining the architecture of the generator and discriminator networks, training the GAN model, tracking the training process, and assessing the performance of the trained model.\n\nHere are the steps discussed in detail:\n\nGather and prepare the data: The data must be cleaned, labeled, and preprocessed to ensure that it is suitable for the model\u2019s training.\nDefine the architecture of the generator and discriminator networks: The generator network creates images using a random noise vector as input, while the discriminator network tries to differentiate between the generated images and the real images from the dataset.\nTrain the GAN model: The generator and discriminator networks are trained concurrently, with the generator attempting to deceive the discriminator by producing realistic images and the discriminator attempting to accurately differentiate between the generated and real images.\nMonitor the training process: Keep an eye on the produced images and the loss functions of both networks to ensure that the generator and discriminator networks are settling on a stable solution. Tweaking the hyperparameters can help to improve the results.\nTest the trained GAN model: Use a different testing set to evaluate the performance of the trained GAN model by creating new images and comparing them to the real images in the testing set. Compute several metrics to evaluate the model\u2019s performance.\nFine-tune the model: Adjust the model\u2019s architecture or hyperparameters, or retrain it on new data to improve its performance.\nDeploy the model: Once the model has been trained and fine-tuned, it can be used to generate images for a variety of applications.\nCreating a GAN model for image synthesis requires careful attention to data preparation, model architecture, training, testing, fine-tuning, and deployment to ensure that the model can generate high-quality and realistic images.\n\nGenerating new images with your model\nAs discussed earlier, a GAN model consists of two networks: the generator and the discriminator. The generator network takes a random noise vector as input and generates an image that is intended to look like a real image. The discriminator network\u2019s task is to determine whether an image is real or fake, i.e., generated by the generator network.\n\nDuring training, the generator network produces fake images, and the discriminator network tries to distinguish between the real and fake images. The generator network learns to produce better fake images by adjusting its parameters to fool the discriminator network. This process continues until the generator network produces images that are indistinguishable from real images.\n\nOnce the GAN model is trained, new images can be generated by providing a random noise vector to the generator network. By adjusting the noise input, interpolating between two images, or applying style transfer, the generator network can be fine-tuned to produce images in a particular style.\n\nHowever, it\u2019s important to note that the GAN model\u2019s capacity to produce high-quality images may be limited. Therefore, it\u2019s crucial to assess the produced images\u2019 quality using various metrics, such as visual inspection or automated evaluation metrics. If the quality of the generated images is not satisfactory, the GAN model can be adjusted, or more training data can be provided to improve the outcomes.\n\nTo ensure that the produced images look realistic and of excellent quality, post-processing methods like picture filtering, color correction, or contrast adjustment can be used. The images generated using the GAN model can be used for various applications, such as art, fashion, design, and entertainment.\n\nApplications of generative AI models for image synthesis\nThere are several uses for generative AI models, especially GANs, in picture synthesis. The following are some of the main applications of generative AI models for picture synthesis:\n\nArt and design: New works of art and design, such as paintings, sculptures, and even furniture, may be produced using generative AI models. For instance, artists can create new patterns, textures, or colour schemes for their artwork using GANs.\n\nGaming: Realistic gaming assets, such as people, locations, or items, can be created using GANs. This can improve the aesthetic appeal of games and provide gamers with a more engaging experience.\n\nFashion: Custom clothing, accessory, or shoe designs can be created with generative AI models for image synthesis. For apparel designers and retailers, this may open up fresh creative opportunities.\n\nAnimation and film: GANs may be used to create animation, visual effects, or even whole scenes for movies and cartoons. By doing this, developing high-quality visual material may be done faster and cheaper.\n\nX-rays, MRIs, and CT scans are just a few examples of the kinds of medical pictures that may be produced with GANs. This can help with medical research, treatment planning, and diagnosis.\n\nGANs may also be used in photography to create high-quality photos from low-resolution ones. This can improve the quality of pictures shot using cheap cameras or mobile devices.\n\nEssentially, there is a plethora of ways in which generative AI models may be used for picture synthesis. They may be utilized to develop new works of art and design, improve games, manufacture original clothing designs, create stunning visual effects, support medical imaging, and more.\n\nEndnote\nDeveloping a generative AI model for picture synthesis necessitates a thorough comprehension of machine learning ideas, including deep neural networks, loss functions, and optimization strategies. The benefits of developing such models, however, are substantial because they have a wide range of uses in industries including art, fashion, and entertainment.\n\nFrom data collection and preprocessing through training and testing the model, the main phases in creating a generative AI model for picture synthesis have been covered in the article. We have also discussed the advantages and disadvantages of several generative models, such as GANs and VAEs.\n\nThe importance of choosing the appropriate architecture and hyperparameters for the model, the significance of data quality and quantity, and the necessity of ongoing model performance monitoring are other important areas we have covered.\n\nIn conclusion, developing a generative AI model for picture synthesis requires a blend of technical proficiency, originality, and in-depth knowledge of the technologies involved.\n\nBuild future-ready generative AI models for image synthesis.

Even though many still associate \u201cmachine learning\u201d with unrealistic sci-fi tales, we now see applications of this technology everywhere around us. Facebook\u2019s chatbots, Spotify and Netflix suggestions, Alexa from Amazon, online spellcheckers, and predictive text on your phone are just a few instances of machine learning technology at work. Market revenue for machine learning (ML) in 2021 was estimated at $15.44 billion. The market is projected to increase from USD 21.17 billion in 2022 to USD 209.91 billion in 2029, with a CAGR of 38.8%.\n\nIndustries are progressively embracing the creation of machine-learning apps that perform various tasks using machine-learning algorithms, including predictive text input, speech recognition, object detection, and more. Additionally, they can gather information from user behavior and preferences, allowing for more individualized recommendations and a better user experience. Machine learning enables tracking heart rate, activity level, and other metrics in real-time on wearable devices like smartwatches and fitness trackers. Incorporating machine learning into applications can enhance user experience and offer insightful data on user behavior and preferences, creating new opportunities for businesses to engage with their clients.\n\nIn this article, we will dive deep into machine learning fundamentals and their components and learn how to build a machine learning app.\n\nWhat is machine learning?\nKey components of machine learning\nMachine learning methods\nMachine learning algorithms\nUse cases of machine learning\nHow to build a machine learning app?\nWhat is machine learning?\nMachine learning is a sub-field of artificial intelligence (AI) that focuses on creating statistical models and algorithms that allow computers to learn and become more proficient at performing particular tasks. Machine learning algorithms create a mathematical model with the help of historical sample data, or \u201ctraining data,\u201d that assists in making predictions or judgments without being explicitly programmed. Machine learning uses computer science and statistics to create prediction models. It requires a huge amount of data to perform well; in short, the higher the volume of data, the higher the accuracy.\n\nWhen a machine learning system receives new data, it forecasts the results based on the patterns learned from the historical data. The amount of data used to train the model affects how precisely the output is predicted because a larger data set allows for the creation of a more accurate model.\n\nOne may readily see the importance of machine learning by looking at numerous applications. Machine learning is presently used in self-driving cars, cyber fraud detection, and face recognition, among other use cases. Some top companies like Netflix and Amazon have created machine-learning models that analyze user interests and offer personalized product suggestions.\n\nKey components of machine learning\nThe key components of machine learning are:\n\nData\nData is a key component in machine learning and provides the foundation for machine learning algorithms. Machines require vast amounts of data to learn from to function and make informed decisions. Any unprocessed information, value, sound, image, or text can be considered data. The accuracy and effectiveness of a machine learning model heavily depend on the quality and quantity of data used for its training.\n\nWhile creating a data set, ensure that it has the 5V characteristics:\n\nVolume: The amount of information required for the model to be accurate and effective matters. The accuracy of the machine learning model will increase with the size of the data collected.\n\nVelocity: The speed of data generation and processing is also crucial. Real-time data processing may be required in some cases to get accurate results.\n\nVariety: The data set should include variety in form, for instance, structured, unstructured, and semi-structured data.\n\nVeracity: Data cleanliness, consistency, and error-free are all qualities and accuracy aspects of data. Only with accurate data a precise output can be expected.\n\nValue: The information in the data must be valuable to draw any conclusion.\n\nModel\nThe model serves as the underlying core component of machine learning and represents the link between input and output to generate precise and fresh data. It is trained on a dataset to identify underlying patterns and produce accurate results. Following training, the model is tested to determine if it can provide fresh and precise data; if the test is successful, it is then used for real-world applications.\n\nLet\u2019s take an example to understand this further. You want to create a model that considers characteristics like age, body mass index (BMI), and blood sugar levels, to identify whether a person has diabetes. We must first compile a dataset of people with diabetes and the associated health metrics. The algorithm uses the dataset of people with diabetes and considers their health indicators to analyze the data for patterns and relationships and generate accurate results. It identifies the underlying relationships between the outcome (diabetes status) and the input features (blood sugar level, BMI, and age).

We must first compile a dataset of people with diabetes and the associated health metrics. The algorithm uses the dataset of people with diabetes and considers their health indicators to analyze the data for patterns and relationships and generate accurate results. It identifies the underlying relationships between the outcome (diabetes status) and the input features (blood sugar level, BMI, and age). Once trained, the model can predict if new patients have diabetes using information like blood sugar level, weight, and age.\n\nAlgorithm\nA model is trained using an algorithm that can learn the hidden patterns from the data, predict the output, and improve the performance from experiences. It is an essential part of machine learning since it powers the learning process and affects the precision and potency of the model.\n\nA training dataset consists of input data and associated output values. Once patterns and associations have been identified in the data, several mathematical and statistical techniques are used to determine the underlying relationship between the input and output. For example, when we have a dataset of animal photos with their matching species labels, we need to train a machine-learning model to identify the species of animals in the photograph. A convolutional neural network (CNN) may be used for this purpose. The CNN method breaks down the incoming visual data into numerous layers of mathematical operations that recognize features like edges, shapes, and patterns. The image is then classified into one of the species categories using these characteristics.\n\nHowever, several alternative methods exist, including decision trees, logistic regression, k-nearest neighbors, etc. The provided dataset and the issues that must be solved determine your algorithm.\n\nMachine learning methods\nMachine learning can be used in various methods for producing valuable outcomes. The various machine learning techniques include:\n\nSupervised learning\nSupervised learning is a subset of machine learning that trains its algorithm using labeled datasets. Labeled data are those that have output tagged along with the input. In this approach, machines are trained using some labeled datasets, and then the machine is expected to produce accurate results using those training data. Here\u2019s an example to help you understand: Images of several animals, including cats and dogs, are given to the machine with labels. The machine uses the animals\u2019 attributes, like shape, size, color, etc., to learn and generate responses. Here the response generated is based on the labeled dataset.\n\nThe two major types of supervised learning are:\n\nClassification\nClassification is used when an output variable is categorical and has two or more classes. For instance, yes or no, true or untrue, male or female, etc. For example, if we want a machine to recognize spam mail, we must first teach it what spam mail is so that it can determine whether a message is a spam. This is done using different spam filters, which examine the email\u2019s topic, body, heading, etc., to check whether it contains deceptive information. Spammers who have already been blacklisted use specific phrases and blacklist filters to blackmail. The message is assessed using all these characteristics to determine its spam score.\n\nRegression\nRegression is utilized when the output variable has a real or continuous value. There is a relationship between two or more variables; a change in one variable is proportional to a change in the other. For instance, estimating a house\u2019s cost based on its size, location, and other factors. Here price of the house is dependent on size, location etc.\n\nUnsupervised learning\nUnsupervised learning involves using unlabeled data for machine learning. The computer seeks trends and patterns in unlabeled data without being specifically told the desired result. Let\u2019s use the prior example to understand this better. Without labels, the machine is provided pictures of animals, such as cats and dogs, to produce the response. The machine analyses patterns in the input and categorizes the data appropriately using characteristics like form, size, color etc. The datasets are completely unlabeled here, and the system compares and analyzes the patterns to generate desired results.\n\nSemi-supervised learning\nSemi-supervised learning refers to machine learning that falls between supervised and unsupervised learning. It is a training method that blends a significant amount of unlabeled data with a small amount of labeled data. Semi-supervised learning seeks to create a function that can accurately predict the output variable from the input variables, just like supervised learning does. An unsupervised learning technique is used to cluster comparable data, which also helps to categorize the unlabeled data into labeled ones. When there is a large amount of unlabeled data accessible but categorizing it all would be expensive or difficult, semi-supervised learning is extremely useful.\n\nFor example, suppose we have a collection of 10,000 photos of animals, but only 1000 have been assigned to the appropriate class, such as dog or cat. With semi-supervised learning, we can train a convolutional neural network (CNN) model to distinguish between dogs and cats using the labeled photos. The remaining 9,000 photos that are not identified can then be labeled using this trained model. With the addition of these anticipated labels, the original labeled dataset can grow from 1000 to 10,000 labels. To increase the model\u2019s accuracy in categorizing dogs and cats, it can then be retrained on the new, larger labeled dataset.\n\nReinforcement learning\nReinforcement learning (RL) is a type of machine learning that involves an autonomous agent learning to make decisions and take actions in an environment to maximize a reward signal. The agent interacts with the environment by taking actions and receiving feedback in the form of rewards or penalties, depending on the outcome of its actions.\n\nRL aims to find the optimal policy, which is a set of rules that tells the agent which action to take in a given state to maximize its long-term reward. The agent learns this policy through trial and error by taking actions, observing the resulting state and reward, and updating its decision-making strategy accordingly.\n\nThe environment in RL is typically defined by a set of states and actions that the agent can take. The agent starts in a given state, takes action, and transitions to a new state. The reward function evaluates the outcome of each action, providing the agent with feedback on its performance. The agent\u2019s objective is to learn the policy that leads to the highest possible reward over time.\n\nIn summary, reinforcement learning is a type of machine learning where an agent learns to take actions in an environment to maximize a reward signal. It is a trial-and-error process where the agent interacts with the environment and receives feedback through rewards or penalties. The goal is to learn the optimal policy, which maximizes the long-term reward.\n\nDeep learning\nDeep learning algorithms are created to learn and develop over time through a process known as backpropagation. The structure and operation of the human brain inspire these algorithms. Deep learning includes training artificial neural networks with numerous layers to evaluate and comprehend complicated data. Deep learning neural networks often include numerous layers of linked nodes, where each layer picks up increasingly abstract properties from the input data. The first layer receives the input data, processes it, and then transfers the results to the following layer. This process is carried out with successive layers, refining the features the prior layer had discovered. The network\u2019s final output is a prediction or classification based on the learned features.\n\nLet\u2019s say we wish to group pictures of animals into subcategories like cats, dogs, and birds. A big collection of labeled photos, where each image is tagged with its appropriate category, could be used to train a deep learning algorithm. Starting with the raw pixel values from the photographs, the algorithm would feed them into a deep neural network comprising many layers of interconnected nodes. Edges, textures, and forms are just a few examples of the abstract qualities each layer would gradually learn from the input data. The network\u2019s final output layer would comprise nodes for each potential category, with each node producing a score indicating a probability that the input image falls into that category.\n\nMachine learning algorithms\nAn algorithm is a series of guidelines or instructions created to solve a particular issue or carry out a certain operation. It is a set of precise actions a computer can carry out to solve a problem or achieve a goal. There are various types of algorithms, a few of which are discussed below:\n\nDecision trees\nThe decision tree algorithm belongs to the supervised learning subset and can be applied to classification and regression issues. Each leaf node of the decision tree corresponds to a class label, and the tree\u2019s internal nodes represent the attributes to resolve the problem. Suppose you want to determine a person\u2019s health based on age, dietary habits, level of physical activity, etc. Questions like \u201cWhat\u2019s the age?\u201d \u201cDoes he exercise?\u201d and \u201cDoes he eat healthy food?\u201d are the decision nodes in this scenario. And the leaves, which represent either \u201chealthy\u201d or \u201cunhealthy,\u201d are the consequences. In this instance, the issue was binary classification (a yes-no type problem). There are various types of decision trees, they are:\n\nClassification trees: These decision trees group or classify input data into multiple classes or categories by their traits or characteristics.\n\nRegression trees: These decision-making structures are employed to forecast a continuous numerical value in light of the input data.\n\nBinary decision trees: These decision trees are classified as binary since each node only has two possible outcomes.\n\nMultiway decision trees: Each node has multiple alternative outcomes in these decision trees.\n\nK-nearest neighbors (K-NN)\nK-nearest neighbors are a supervised machine-learning technique for solving classification and regression issues. Nevertheless, classification issues are where it\u2019s most frequently applied. It is considered a non-parametric method since it makes no assumptions about the underlying data distribution. When accepting input, it doesn\u2019t do any calculations or other operations; instead, it retains the information until the query is executed. It is a great option for data mining and is also referred to as a lazy learning algorithm.\n\nThe parameter \u201cK\u201d in K-NN controls how many nearest neighbors will participate in the voting. K-NN uses a voting system to identify the class of an unobserved observation. As a result, the class with the most votes will be the class of the relevant data point. If K equals 1, we will only utilize the data point\u2019s closest neighbor to classify the data point. We will use the ten closest neighbors if K equals ten, and so on. It is straightforward to comprehend and apply the k-nearest neighbors categorization method, and it works best when the data points are non-linear.\n\nSupport vector machines\nOne of the most prominent supervised learning algorithms, Support Vector Machine, or SVM, is used to solve Classification and Regression problems. However, it is largely employed in Machine Learning Classification issues. The SVM algorithm aims to establish the best decision boundary or line to divide n-dimensional space into classes so that subsequent data points can be assigned to the appropriate category. The term \u201chyperplane\u201d refers to this optimal decision boundary. To create the hyperplane, SVM selects the extreme points and vectors.\n\nFinding a hyperplane in an N-dimensional space that classifies the data points is the goal of the SVM method. The number of features determines the hyperplane\u2019s size. The hyperplane is essentially a line if there are just two input features, and the hyperplane turns into a 2-D plane if there are three input features. Imagining something with more than three features gets challenging.\n\nThe SVM technique can be used to develop a model that can accurately determine the outcome. For example, the image contains a basket of fruits (apple and banana), and we want the system to identify these fruits. We will train our model with several photographs of apples and bananas to become familiar with the attributes of these fruits. As a result, the support vector will see the extreme cases and attributes of apples and bananas when drawing a judgment border between these two data sets. Based on the support vectors, it will categorize it as an apple or banana.\n\nNeural networks\nA neural network is an artificial intelligence technique instructing computers to analyze data. The human brain is the inspiration behind neural network architecture. Human brain cells, called neurons, form a complex, highly interconnected network and send electrical signals to each other to help humans process information. Similarly, an artificial neural network comprises neurons that work together to solve problems. Artificial neurons are software modules called nodes, and artificial neural networks are software programs or algorithms that, at their core, use computing systems to solve mathematical calculations. Computers can use this to build an adaptive system that helps them improve by learning from their failures. As a result, artificial neural networks try to tackle challenging issues like summarising documents or identifying faces.\n\nThe input layer, hidden layer, and output layer are the three layers that make up a simple neural network. The input layer is where data from the outside world enters an artificial neural network. Input nodes process, analyze, or categorize data before forwarding it to the hidden layer. The input or other hidden layers serve as the input for hidden layers. Artificial neural networks can have a lot of hidden layers. Each hidden layer evaluates the output from the preceding layer, refines it, and then sends it to the output layer. The artificial neural network\u2019s output layer presents the complete data processing results.\n\nFeedforward neural networks, also known as multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs), convolutional neural networks (CNNs), and recurrent neural networks (RNNs), are among the various types of neural networks that are used for different purposes.\n\nClustering\nIt is an unsupervised learning method, meaning the algorithm gets no supervision and works with an unlabeled dataset. The unlabeled dataset is grouped using machine learning clustering or cluster analysis. It can be described as a method of dividing the data points into clusters of related data points.\n\nIt identifies some comparable patterns in the unlabeled dataset, including shape, size, color, behavior, etc., and divides them into groups based on the presence or absence of those similar patterns. For example, in a shopping center, t-shirts are classified in one section, trousers in another, and fruits and vegetables are arranged in different sections to help customers find the products easily. The clustering process operates similarly.\n\nThe two main clustering techniques are Hard clustering (where each data point belongs to a single group) and Soft Clustering (data points can belong to another group also). However, there are several different Clustering techniques also available. The primary clustering techniques in machine learning are listed below:\n\nPartitioning clustering\u2013 This clustering method divides the data into non-hierarchical groups. It\u2019s also known as the centroid-based approach. The K-Means Clustering algorithm is the most popular example of partitioning clustering. The dataset is split into k groups, where K", "doc_id": "99c318a9-ce3f-4ccf-9417-9d8bd3a778fd", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "e05e5c5a9ac493fd9c1a83d6275189b422c93f7df6736cf9672543ccb8870a32", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 252588, "end": 268910}, "relationships": {"1": "d9152908-bd15-4715-85df-a4e7536a87b3", "2": "da9ff061-8944-4071-8577-a04015978d2e", "3": "8739e03a-3f52-4699-98d3-3d532e105cd8"}, "__type__": "1"}, "8739e03a-3f52-4699-98d3-3d532e105cd8": {"text": "center, t-shirts are classified in one section, trousers in another, and fruits and vegetables are arranged in different sections to help customers find the products easily. The clustering process operates similarly.\n\nThe two main clustering techniques are Hard clustering (where each data point belongs to a single group) and Soft Clustering (data points can belong to another group also). However, there are several different Clustering techniques also available. The primary clustering techniques in machine learning are listed below:\n\nPartitioning clustering\u2013 This clustering method divides the data into non-hierarchical groups. It\u2019s also known as the centroid-based approach. The K-Means Clustering algorithm is the most popular example of partitioning clustering. The dataset is split into k groups, where K refers to the number of pre-defined groups. The cluster centroid is designed to have a minimum distance between data points in one cluster compared to other cluster centroids.\nDensity-based clustering\u2013 The density-based clustering algorithm joins into clusters, and arbitrary shapes are formed as long as the highly packed regions can be connected. After discovering several clusters in the dataset, the algorithm groups the high-density areas into clusters. The sparser areas in data space separate the dense sections from one another. If the dataset includes many dimensions and densities, these algorithms may have trouble clustering the data points.\nDistribution model-based clustering\u2013 In the distribution model-based clustering method, the data is separated according to the likelihood that each dataset corresponds to a specific distribution. A few distributions\u2014most frequently the Gaussian distribution\u2014are presumptively used to classify the objects.\nHierarchical clustering\u2013 Hierarchical clustering can be utilized as an alternative to partitioned clustering, as there is no need to pre-specify the number of clusters to be produced. This method divides the dataset into clusters to produce a structure resembling a tree known as a dendrogram. Removing the appropriate amount of the tree makes it possible to choose the observations or any number of clusters. The Agglomerative Hierarchical algorithm is the most popular example of this technique.\nFuzzy clustering\u2013 When using fuzzy clustering, data points might be included in more than one category (or \u201ccluster\u201d). To identify patterns or commonalities between items in a set, clustering separates data points into sections based on the similarity between items; items in clusters should be similar and distinct from items in other groups.\nApart from the above-discussed algorithms, many other algorithms are used in machine learning, such as Na\u00efve Bayes Algorithm, Random Forest Algorithm, Apriori Algorithm etc.\n\nUse cases of machine learning\nAutomating numerous time-consuming processes has made machine-learning apps a vital part of our life. Here are a few examples of typical use cases:\n\nSelf-driving cars\nSelf-driving cars heavily use machine learning algorithms to assess and analyze huge amounts of real-time information from sensors, cameras, and other sources. Machine learning algorithms are employed to identify and categorize items, such as cars, people walking on the pavement, and traffic signs, to decide how the automobile should navigate the road. To get better at driving over time, such as responding to shifting road conditions and avoiding collisions, these algorithms also learn from prior driving experiences. Utilizing machine learning, self-driving vehicles can provide passengers with increased safety, effectiveness, and convenience while reducing traffic congestion.\n\nPredict traffic patterns\nMachine learning is commonly used in the logistics and transportation industries to predict traffic patterns. To accurately predict traffic patterns and congestion levels, machine learning algorithms can examine enormous volumes of historical traffic data, including weather, time of day, and other factors. These forecasts can streamline traffic flow, lessen obstructions and delays, and optimize vehicle travel times. Moreover, ML can forecast demand for public transportation, improve traffic signal timing, and give drivers real-time traffic alerts and alternate routes. Cities and transportation agencies may increase the effectiveness and safety of their transportation systems, lower carbon emissions, and improve the overall travel experience for customers by utilizing machine learning to predict traffic patterns.\n\nFraud detection\nMachine learning is crucial for detecting fraud in the financial, e-commerce, and other sectors. Machine learning algorithms can evaluate massive volumes of transactional data, including user behavior, past transactions, and other factors, to find trends and abnormalities that might indicate fraudulent conduct. To increase their precision and recognize new forms of fraudulent activity, these algorithms can learn from prior instances of fraud. Organizations can decrease financial losses, avoid reputational harm, and increase consumer trust by utilizing machine learning for fraud detection. Moreover, it can optimize fraud protection methods, detect fraud in real time, and streamline investigation processes. In general, machine learning is a potent fraud detection technique that can assist firms in staying ahead of the growing cyber risks and safeguarding their resources and clients from criminal activities.\n\nImage recognition\nMachine learning is used extensively in various sectors, including security, retail, and healthcare. ML algorithms can evaluate and classify huge amounts of visual data, including medical photos, product images, and surveillance footage, to find patterns and features that distinguish one thing from another.\n\nImage recognition is used in the healthcare industry to evaluate medical pictures such as X-rays, MRIs, and CT scans to detect and treat diseases. In the retail industry, it is used to analyze product images, find flaws, and locate counterfeit goods. Image recognition is used in security to review surveillance footage, spot potential dangers, and monitor crowd behavior. Organizations may automate image analysis activities, increase accuracy and efficiency, and uncover new insights and prospects by utilizing machine learning algorithms for image recognition.\n\nSpeech recognition\nA well-known use of machine learning (ML) is speech recognition. Computers can understand and recognize human voices using machine learning (ML) techniques and then translate them into text or other data types that may be utilized for various tasks.\n\nAmong the frequent applications of speech recognition enabled by ML are:\n\nVirtual assistants: The core technology behind virtual assistants like Amazon\u2019s Alexa, Apple\u2019s Siri, Google Assistant, and Microsoft\u2019s Cortana is speech recognition. These helpers can answer inquiries, play music, create reminders, and execute other chores by understanding natural language commands.\n\nTranscription: Voice recognition is frequently used to convert audio and video content, including meetings, interviews, podcasts, and dictations, into written text. Machine learning (ML) algorithms can accurately convert spoken words into text, saving time and effort compared to manual transcription.\n\nCustomer service: Customer support interactions can be automated in call centers using ML-powered speech recognition. Automatic voice systems can recognize client inquiries, respond to them, and route calls to the agent or department as and when required.\n\nHow to build a machine learning app?\nHere is a general breakdown of the procedure needed to create machine-learning apps. We will use the Naive Bayes Classifier, one of the simplest machine learning techniques, and construct an app that forecasts airline information whenever a query is generated. The following stages demonstrate how to build a machine-learning app:\n\nStep 1- Libraries and datasets\nIn this step, install scikit-learn and pandas:\n\npip install scikit-learn\npip install pandas\nWe\u2019ll apply a dataset using an example of airline travel where we create a query regarding the information on flights, and we get the response as per the query generated. Let\u2019s examine this dataset using Pandas.\n\nLibraries and datasets Intent\nimport pandas as pd\n\ndf_train = pd.read_csv('atis_intents_train.csv')\ndf_test = pd.read_csv('atis_intents_test.csv')\nStep 2- Preprocess data\nIn this process, we clean the raw data. Before running the algorithm, the dataset is preprocessed to look for missing values, noisy data, and other abnormalities.\n\ndf_train = pd.read_csv('atis_intents_train.csv')\ndf_train.columns = ['intent','text']\ndf_train = df_train[['text','intent']]\ndf_test = pd.read_csv('atis_intents_test.csv')\ndf_test.columns = ['intent','text']\ndf_test = df_test[['text','intent']]\nStep 3- Remove extra spaces\nExtra spaces between the text and intent are removed using the strip method. Use the following code to remove spaces.\n\ndf_train['text'] = df_train['text'].str.strip()\ndf_train['intent'] = df_train['intent'].str.strip()\ndf_test['text'] = df_test['text'].str.strip()\ndf_test['intent'] = df_test['intent'].str.strip()\nStep 4- Vectorize the text data using TF-IDF\nWe will vectorize the data to convert it into numerical form, which would be the training input.\n\nvectorizer = TfidfVectorizer(stop_words='english')\nX_train = vectorizer.fit_transform(df_train['text'])\nX_test = vectorizer.transform(df_test['text'])\nStep 5- Encode the target variable\nWe store the labels corresponding to the data points from the training and testing dataset in y_train and y_test, respectively.\n\ny_train = df_train['intent']\ny_test = df_test['intent']\nStep 6- Train a Naive Bayes classifier\nWe are using the Naive Bayes classifier, and the code we used are:\n\nclf = MultinomialNB()\nclf.fit(X_train, y_train)\nStep 7- Install flask and quick set up\nRun the following line in the terminal to install the flask.\n\npip install flask\nStep 8- Define the flask app\nNow follow these instructions to ensure everything is operating properly.\n\nThe following code is an example of a simple app taken from the Flask documentation.\n\napp = Flask(__name__)\n@app.route('/')\ndef home():\nreturn render_template('index.html')\nLet\u2019s explain this further:\n\napp = Flask( name__) \u2013 Creates a Flask class instance with the command app Flask name. The name of the application\u2019s module is represented by the variable name, which aids Flask in knowing where to seek resources like \u201ctemplates,\u201d which we\u2019ll utilize later.\n@app.route(\u201c/\u201d): @ \u2013 denotes decorators (they modify the behavior of a function or class). Flask is informed by the route() decorator, which URL should call our function.\nStep 9 \u2013 Make an HTML file\nTo begin building the front end, first, create a folder where your app is stored called \u201ctemplates\u201d (you are not allowed to use any other name). Make an HTML file and place it in the \u201ctemplates\u201d folder. You can give this file whatever name you like; we named it index.html.\n\nOpen the HTML file, type doc or HTML and hit the Tab key. Furthermore, your IDE will produce a simple HTML template for you. If not, copy and paste the template below.\n\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html >\n<head>\n  <meta charset=\"UTF-8\">\n  <title>My Machine Learning Model</title>\n  <!-- Quick Start: CSS -->\n  <link href=\"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.1.3/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css\" rel=\"stylesheet\" integrity=\"sha384-1BmE4kWBq78iYhFldvKuhfTAU6auU8tT94WrHftjDbrCEXSU1oBoqyl2QvZ6jIW3\" crossorigin=\"anonymous\">\nStep 10- Add navigation bar\nGo to the website\u2019s navbar section, copy and paste the code into the< head> section. We\u2019ll also add a navigation bar (we don\u2019t need it, but it\u2019ll help you get accustomed to bootstrap).\n\nWe will modify the navbar\u2019s color to dark before running the script by changing the light components in the first line of code to dark (if you leave it as is, it will have a light color).\n\n  <!-- Nav Bar -->\n  <nav class=\"navbar navbar-expand-lg navbar-dark bg-dark\">\n    <div class=\"container-fluid\">\n      <a class=\"navbar-brand\" href=\"#\">Navbar</a>\n      <button class=\"navbar-toggler\" type=\"button\" data-bs-toggle=\"collapse\" data-bs-target=\"#navbarSupportedContent\" aria-controls=\"navbarSupportedContent\" aria-expanded=\"false\" aria-label=\"Toggle navigation\">\n        <span class=\"navbar-toggler-icon\"></span>\n      </button>\n      <div class=\"collapse navbar-collapse\" id=\"navbarSupportedContent\">\n        <ul class=\"navbar-nav me-auto mb-2 mb-lg-0\">\n          <li class=\"nav-item\">\n            <a class=\"nav-link active\" aria-current=\"page\" href=\"#\">Home</a>\n          </li>\n          <li class=\"nav-item\">\n            <a class=\"nav-link\" href=\"#\">Link</a>\n          </li>\n          <li class=\"nav-item dropdown\">\n            <a class=\"nav-link dropdown-toggle\" href=\"#\" id=\"navbarDropdown\" role=\"button\" data-bs-toggle=\"dropdown\" aria-expanded=\"false\">\n              Dropdown\n            </a>\n            <ul class=\"dropdown-menu\" aria-labelledby=\"navbarDropdown\">\n              <li><a class=\"dropdown-item\" href=\"#\">Action</a></li>\n              <li><a class=\"dropdown-item\" href=\"#\">Another action</a></li>\n              <li><hr class=\"dropdown-divider\"></li>\n              <li><a class=\"dropdown-item\" href=\"#\">Something else here</a></li>\n            </ul>\n          </li>\n          <li class=\"nav-item\">\n            <a class=\"nav-link disabled\">Disabled</a>\n          </li>\n        </ul>\n        <form class=\"d-flex\">\n          <input class=\"form-control", "doc_id": "8739e03a-3f52-4699-98d3-3d532e105cd8", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "3fde5e0a091b79ab42c227ecd83dd5371ba04a4f951504a6974acaca00441635", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 268927, "end": 282428}, "relationships": {"1": "d9152908-bd15-4715-85df-a4e7536a87b3", "2": "99c318a9-ce3f-4ccf-9417-9d8bd3a778fd", "3": "f4bf6058-801e-4c51-b4b3-8df7f57b12e2"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f4bf6058-801e-4c51-b4b3-8df7f57b12e2": {"text": "action</a></li>\n              <li><hr class=\"dropdown-divider\"></li>\n              <li><a class=\"dropdown-item\" href=\"#\">Something else here</a></li>\n            </ul>\n          </li>\n          <li class=\"nav-item\">\n            <a class=\"nav-link disabled\">Disabled</a>\n          </li>\n        </ul>\n        <form class=\"d-flex\">\n          <input class=\"form-control me-2\" type=\"search\" placeholder=\"Search\" aria-label=\"Search\">\n          <button class=\"btn btn-outline-success\" type=\"submit\">Search</button>\n        </form>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n  </nav>\n</head>\n \n\nStep 11 \u2013 POST request using form element through UI\nWe are making a post request via form element, which will hit the endpoint at the backend, providing us with the desired outcome.\n\n<body>\n <div class=\"login\">\n  <h2>Airline Travel Information System</h2>\n    <p>Enter Your Query:</p>\n     <!-- Inputs for our ML model -->\n      <form action=\"{{ url_for('predict')}}\" method=\"post\">\n        <input type=\"text\" name=\"text\" placeholder=\"Text\" required=\"required\" />\n        <button type=\"submit\" class=\"btn btn-primary btn-block btn-large\">Predict Value!</button>\n      </form>\n    <br>\n    <br>\n  <b> {{ prediction_text }} </b>\n </div>\n</body>\n</html>\n \n\nStep 12- See the result\nWhen you add a query, the system will provide the desired outcomes.\n\n\nEndnote\nMachine learning is a subset of AI that enables machines to extract information from data and make predictions or judgments without being explicitly programmed. As a result, it has become a useful tool for businesses looking to gather information, streamline operations, and enhance decision-making. Its capacity to learn from data and improve over time has caused a rise in its use across industries, from finance and e-commerce to healthcare. Machine learning applications have improved the ability to detect fraud, recognize faces in pictures, recognize speech, and perform other time-consuming tasks.\n\nDeveloping machine learning apps is a complex process that demands a deep understanding of algorithms, data science, and statistics.

Global adoption of generative AI has opened up new frontiers in content generation, and businesses have a fun way to innovate and scale. The Financial Times reported that investments in generative AI exceeded $2 billion in 2022. The Wall Street Journal set OpenAI\u2019s potential sale price at $29 Billion, which clearly shows the immense interest of corporations and investors in generative AI technology. Businesses are exploring the endless possibilities of generative AI as the world embraces technology and automation. This type of artificial intelligence can create autonomous digital-only businesses that can interact with people without the need for human intervention.\n\nAs enterprises begin to use generative AI for various purposes, such as marketing, customer service and learning, we see rapid adoption of generative AI across industries. This type of AI can generate marketing content, pitch documents and product ideas, create sophisticated advertising campaigns and do much more. Generative AI allows for absolute customizability, improving conversion rates and boosting revenue for businesses. DeepMind\u2019s Alpha Code, GoogleLab, OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT, DALL-E, MidJourney, Jasper and Stable Diffusion are some of the prominent generative AI platforms being widely used currently.\n\nThis technology has many use cases, including business and customer applications, customer management systems, digital healthcare, automated software engineering and customer management systems. It is worth noting, however, that this type of AI technology constantly evolves, indicating endless opportunities for autonomous enterprises. This article will take a deep dive into the generative AI tech stack to provide readers with an insider\u2019s perspective on the working of generative AI.\n\nWhat is generative AI?\nWhy is a comprehensive tech stack essential in building effective generative AI systems?\nA detailed overview of the generative AI tech stack\nApplication layer\nModel layer\nInfrastructure layer\nThings to consider while choosing a generative AI tech stack\nWhat is generative AI?\nGenerative AI is a type of artificial intelligence that can produce new data, images, text, or music resembling the dataset it was trained on. This is achieved through \u201cgenerative modeling,\u201d which utilizes statistical algorithms to learn the patterns and relationships within the dataset and leverage this knowledge to generate new data. Generative AI\u2019s capabilities go far beyond creating fun mobile apps and avatars. They are used to create art pieces, design, code, blog posts and all types of high-quality content. Generative AI uses semi-supervised and unsupervised learning algorithms to process large amounts of data to create outputs. Using large language models, computer programs in generative AI understand the text and create new content. The neural network, the heart of generative AI, detects the characteristics of specific images or text and then applies them when necessary. Computer programs can use generative AI to predict patterns and produce the corresponding content. However, it is worth noting that generative AI models are limited in their parameters, and human involvement is essential to make the most of generative AI, both at the beginning and the end of model training.\n\nTo achieve desired results, generative AI uses GANs and transformers.\n\nGAN \u2013 General Adversarial Network\nGANs have two parts: a generator and a discriminator.\n\nThe generative neural network creates outputs upon request and is usually exposed to the necessary data to learn patterns. It needs assistance from the discriminative neural network to improve further. The discriminator neural network, the second element of the model, attempts to distinguish real-world data from the model\u2019s fake data. The first model that fools the second model gets rewarded every time, which is why the algorithm is often called an adversarial model. This allows the model to improve itself without any human input.\n\n\nTransformers\nTransformers are another important component in generative AI that can produce impressive results. Transformers use a sequence rather than individual data points when transforming input into output. This makes them more efficient in processing data when the context matters. Texts contain more than words, and transformers frequently translate and generate them. Transformers can also be used to create a foundation model, which is useful when engineers work on algorithms that can transform natural language requests into commands, such as creating images or text based on user description.\n\nA transformer employs an encoder/decoder architecture. The encoder extracts features from an input sentence, and the decoder uses those features to create an output sentence (translation). Multiple encoder blocks make up the encoder of the transformer. The input sentence is passed through encoder blocks. The output of the last block is the input feature to the decoder. Multiple decoder blocks comprise the decoder, each receiving the encoder\u2019s features.\n\n\nWhy is a comprehensive tech stack essential in building effective generative AI systems?\nA tech stack refers to a set of technologies, frameworks, and tools used to build and deploy software applications. A comprehensive tech stack is crucial in building effective generative AI systems, which include various components, such as machine learning frameworks, programming languages, cloud infrastructure, and data processing tools. These fundamental components and their importance in a generative AI tech stack have been discussed here:\n\nMachine learning frameworks: Generative AI systems rely on complex machine learning models to generate new data. Machine learning frameworks such as TensorFlow, PyTorch and Keras provide a set of tools and APIs to build and train models, and they also provide a variety of pre-built models for image, text, and music generation. So these frameworks and APIs should be integral to the generative AI tech stack. These frameworks also offer flexibility in designing and customizing the models to achieve the desired level of accuracy and quality.\nProgramming languages: Programming languages are crucial in building generative AI systems that balance ease of use and the performance of generative AI models. Python is the most commonly used language in the field of machine learning and is preferred for building generative AI systems due to its simplicity, readability, and extensive library support. Other programming languages like R and Julia are also used in some cases.\nCloud infrastructure: Generative AI systems require large amounts of computing power and storage capacity to train and run the models. Including cloud infrastructures in a generative AI tech stack is essential as it provides the scalability and flexibility needed to deploy generative AI systems. Cloud providers like Amazon Web Services (AWS), Google Cloud Platform (GCP), and Microsoft Azure offer a range of services like virtual machines, storage, and machine learning platforms.\nData processing tools: Data is critical in building generative AI systems. The data must be preprocessed, cleaned, and transformed before it can be used to train the models. Data processing tools like Apache Spark and Apache Hadoop are commonly used in a generative AI tech stack to handle large datasets efficiently. These tools also provide data visualization and exploration capabilities, which can help understand the data and identify patterns.\nA well-designed generative AI tech stack can improve the system\u2019s accuracy, scalability, and reliability, enabling faster development and deployment of generative AI applications.\n\nHere is a comprehensive generative AI tech stack.\n\nComponent \tTechnologies\nMachine learning frameworks\tTensorFlow, PyTorch, Keras\nProgramming languages\tPython, Julia, R\nData preprocessing\tNumPy, Pandas, OpenCV\nVisualization\tMatplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly\nOther tools\tJupyter Notebook, Anaconda, Git\nGenerative models\tGANs, VAEs, Autoencoders, LSTMs\nDeployment\tFlask, Docker, Kubernetes\nCloud services\tAWS, GCP, Azure\nA detailed overview of the generative AI tech stack\nThe generative AI tech stack comprises three fundamental layers:\n\nThe applications layer includes end-to-end apps or third-party APIs that integrate generative AI models into user-facing products.\nThe model layer comprises proprietary APIs or open-source checkpoints that power AI products.

This layer requires a hosting solution for deployment.\nThe infrastructure layer encompasses cloud platforms and hardware manufacturers responsible for running training and inference workloads for generative AI models.\nLet\u2019s dive deep into each layer.\n\n\nApplication layer\nThe application layer of the generative AI tech stack is where the magic happens, as it allows humans and machines to collaborate in new and exciting ways. These powerful applications serve as essential workflow tools, making AI models accessible and easy to use for both businesses and consumers seeking entertainment. With the help of the application layer, the potential for generating truly groundbreaking outcomes is limitless. Whether you\u2019re looking to boost your business\u2019s productivity or seeking new and innovative forms of entertainment, the application layer of the generative AI tech stack is the key to unlocking the full potential of this cutting-edge technology.\n\nFurther, we can segregate this layer into two broad types:\n\nEnd-to-end apps using proprietary models \nEnd-to-end apps using proprietary generative AI models are becoming increasingly popular. These software applications incorporate generative AI models into a user-facing product and are responsible for all aspects of the generative AI pipeline, including data collection, model training, inference, and deployment to production. The proprietary generative AI models used in these apps are developed and owned by a company or organization, typically protected by intellectual property rights and not publicly available. Instead, they are made available to customers as part of a software product or service.\n\nCompanies that develop these models have domain-specific expertise in a particular area. For instance, a company specializing in computer vision might develop an end-to-end app that uses a proprietary generative AI model to create realistic images or videos where the models are highly specialized and can be trained to generate outputs tailored to a specific use case or industry. Some popular examples of such apps include OpenAI\u2019s DALL-E, Codex, and ChatGPT.\n\nThese apps have a broad range of applications, from generating text and images to automating customer service and creating personalized recommendations. They can revolutionize multiple industries by providing highly customized outputs tailored to meet the specific needs of businesses and individuals. As the field of generative AI continues to evolve, we will likely see even more innovative end-to-end apps using proprietary generative AI models that push the boundaries of what is possible.\n\nApps without proprietary models\nApps that utilize generative AI models but do not rely on proprietary models are commonly used in end-user-facing B2B and B2C applications. These types of apps are usually built using open-source generative AI frameworks or libraries, such as TensorFlow, PyTorch, or Keras. These frameworks provide developers with the tools they need to build custom generative AI models for specific use cases. Some popular examples of these apps include RunwayML, StyleGAN, NeuralStyler, and others. By using open-source frameworks and libraries, developers can access a broad range of resources and support communities to build their own generative AI models that are highly customizable and can be tailored to meet specific business needs, enabling organizations to create highly specialized outputs that are impossible with proprietary models.\n\nUsing open-source frameworks and libraries also helps democratize access to generative AI technology, making it accessible to a broader range of individuals and businesses. By enabling developers to build their own models, these tools foster innovation and creativity, driving new use cases and applications for generative AI technology.\n\nModel layer\nThe above apps are based on AI models, that operate across a trifecta of layers. The unique combination of these layers allows maximum flexibility, depending on your market\u2019s specific needs and nuances. Whether you require a broad range of features or hyper-focused specialization, the three layers of AI engines below provide the foundation for creating remarkable generative tech outputs.\n\nGeneral AI models \nAt the heart of the generative tech revolution lies the foundational breakthrough of general AI models. General AI models are a type of artificial intelligence that aims to replicate human-like thinking and decision-making processes. Unlike narrow AI models designed to perform specific tasks or solve specific problems, general AI models are intended to be more versatile and adaptable, and they can perform a wide range of tasks and learn from experience. These versatile models, including GPT-3 for text, DALL-E-2 for images, Whisper for voice, and Stable Diffusion for various applications, can handle a broad range of outputs across categories such as text, images, videos, speech, and games. Designed to be user-friendly and open-source, these models represent a powerful starting point for the generative tech revolution. However, this is just the beginning, and the evolution of generative tech is far from over.\n\nThe development and implementation of general AI models hold numerous potential benefits. One of the most significant advantages is the ability to enhance efficiency and productivity across various industries. General AI models can automate tasks and processes that are currently performed by humans, freeing up valuable time and resources for more complex and strategic work. This can help businesses operate more efficiently, decrease costs, and become more competitive in their respective markets.\n\nMoreover, general AI models have the potential to solve complex problems and generate more accurate predictions. For instance, in the healthcare industry, general AI models can be used to scrutinize vast amounts of patient data and detect patterns and correlations that are challenging or impossible for humans to discern. This can lead to more precise diagnoses, improved treatment options, and better patient outcomes.\n\nIn addition, general AI models can learn and adapt over time. As these models are exposed to more data and experience, they can continue to enhance their performance and become more accurate and effective. This can result in more reliable and consistent outcomes, which can be highly valuable in industries where accuracy and precision are critical.\n\nSpecific AI models\nSpecialized AI models, also known as domain-specific models, are designed to excel in specific tasks such as generating ad copy, tweets, song lyrics, and even creating e-commerce photos or 3D interior design images. These models are trained on highly specific and relevant data, allowing them to perform with greater nuance and precision than general AI models. For instance, an AI model trained on e-commerce photos would deeply understand the specific features and attributes that make an e-commerce photo effective, such as lighting, composition, and product placement. With this specialized knowledge, the model can generate highly effective e-commerce photos that outperform general models in this domain. Likewise, specific AI models trained on song lyrics can generate lyrics with greater nuances and subtlety than general models. These models analyze the structure, tone, and style of different genres and artists to generate lyrics that are not only grammatically correct but also stylistically and thematically appropriate for a specific artist or genre.\n\nAs generative tech continues to evolve, more specialized models are expected to become open-sourced and available to a broader range of users. This will make it easier for businesses and individuals to access and use these highly effective AI models, potentially leading to new innovations and breakthroughs in various industries.\n\nHyperlocal AI models\nHyperlocal AI models are the pinnacle of generative technology and excel in their specific fields. With hyperlocal and often proprietary data, these models can achieve unparalleled levels of accuracy and specificity in their outputs. These models can generate outputs with exceptional precision, from writing scientific articles that adhere to the style of a specific journal to creating interior design models that meet the aesthetic preferences of a particular individual. The capabilities of hyperlocal AI models extend to creating e-commerce photos that are perfectly lit and shadowed to align with a specific company\u2019s branding or marketing strategy. These models are designed to be specialists in their fields, enabling them to produce highly customized and accurate outputs.\n\nAs generative tech advances, hyperlocal AI models are expected to become even more sophisticated and precise, which could lead to new innovations and breakthroughs in various industries. These models can potentially transform how businesses operate by providing highly customized outputs that align with their specific needs. This will result in increased efficiency, productivity, and profitability for businesses.\n\nInfrastructure layer\nThe infrastructure layer of a generative AI tech stack is a critical component that consists of hardware and software components necessary for creating and training AI models. Hardware components in this layer may involve specialized processors like GPUs or TPUs that can handle the complex computations required for AI training and inference. By leveraging these processors, developers can process massive amounts of data faster and more efficiently. Moreover, combining these processors with storage systems can help effectively store and retrieve massive data.\n\nOn the other hand, software components within the infrastructure layer play a critical role in providing developers with the necessary tools to build and train AI models. Frameworks like TensorFlow or PyTorch offer tools for developing custom generative AI models for specific use cases. Additionally, other software components, such as data management tools, data visualization tools, and optimization and deployment tools, also play a significant role in the infrastructure layer. These tools help manage and preprocess data, monitor training and inferencing, and optimize and deploy trained models.\n\nCloud computing services can also be part of the infrastructure layer, providing organizations instant access to extensive computing resources and storage capacity. Cloud-based infrastructure can help organizations save money by reducing the cost and complexity of developing and deploying AI models while allowing them to quickly and efficiently scale their AI capabilities.\n\nThings to consider while choosing a generative AI tech stack\nProject specifications and features\nIt is important to consider your project\u2019s size and purpose when creating a generative AI tech stack, as they significantly impact which technologies are chosen. The more important the project, the more complex and extensive the tech stack. Medium and large projects require more complex technology stacks with multiple levels of programming languages and frameworks to ensure integrity and performance. From a generative AI context, the following points must be taken into consideration as part of project specifications and features while creating a generative AI tech stack \u2013\n\nThe type of data you plan to generate, such as images, text, or music, will influence your choice of the generative AI technique. For instance, GANs are typically used for image and video data, while RNNs are more suitable for text and music data.\nThe project\u2019s complexity, such as the number of input variables, the number of layers in the model, and the size of the dataset, will also impact the choice of the generative AI tech stack. Complex projects may require more powerful hardware like GPUs and advanced frameworks like TensorFlow or PyTorch.\nIf your project requires scalability, such as generating a large number of variations or supporting too many users, you may need to choose a generative AI tech stack that can scale easily, such as cloud-based solutions like AWS, Google Cloud Platform, or Azure.\nThe accuracy of the generative AI model is critical for many applications, such as drug discovery or autonomous driving. If accuracy is a primary concern, you may need to choose a technique known for its high accuracy, such as VAEs or RNNs.\nThe speed of the generative AI model may be a crucial factor in some applications, such as real-time video generation or online chatbots. In such cases, you may need to choose a generative AI tech stack that prioritizes speed, such as using lightweight models or optimizing the code for performance.\nExperience and resources\nIt is essential to have deep technical and architectural knowledge to select the right generative AI tech stack. It is crucial to be able to distinguish between different technologies and select the specific technologies meticulously when creating stacks so that you can work confidently. The decision should not force developers to lose time learning about the technology and be unable to move forward effectively.\n\nHere are some ways experience and resources impact the choice of technology:\n\nThe experience and expertise of the development team can impact the choice of technology. If the team has extensive experience in a particular programming language or framework, choosing a generative AI tech stack that aligns with their expertise may be beneficial to expedite development.\nThe availability of resources, such as hardware and software, can also impact the choice of technology. If the team has access to powerful hardware such as GPUs, they may be able to use more advanced frameworks such as TensorFlow or PyTorch to develop the system.\nThe availability of training and support resources is also an important factor. If the development team requires training or support to use a particular technology effectively, it may be necessary to choose a generative AI tech stack that has a robust support community or training resources.\nThe budget for the project can also influence what technology stack is used. More advanced frameworks and hardware can be expensive, so choosing a more cost-effective tech stack that meets the project\u2019s requirements may be necessary if the project has a limited budget.\nThe maintenance and support requirements of the system can also impact the choice of technology. If the system requires regular updates and maintenance, it may be beneficial to choose a generative AI tech stack that is easy to maintain and that comes with a reliable support community.\nScalability\nScalability is an essential feature of your application\u2019s architecture that determines whether your application can handle an increased load. Hence, your technology stack should be able to handle such growth if necessary. There are two types of scaling: vertical and horizontal. The first refers to the ability to handle increasing users across multiple devices, whereas horizontal scaling refers to the ability to add new features and elements to the application in the future.\n\nHere are some factors that matter when it comes to scalability in a generative AI tech stack:\n\nWhen it comes to choosing a generative AI tech stack, the size of the dataset plays a critical role. As large datasets require more powerful hardware and software to handle, a distributed computing framework like Apache Spark may be essential for efficient data processing.\nAdditionally, the number of users interacting with the system is another significant consideration. If a large number of users are expected, choosing a tech stack that can handle a high volume of requests may be necessary. This may involve opting for a cloud-based solution or a microservices architecture.\nReal-time processing is yet another consideration where the system must be highly scalable in applications such as live video generation or online chatbots to cope with the volume of requests. In such cases, optimizing the code for performance or using a lightweight model may be necessary to ensure the system can process requests quickly.\nIn scenarios where batch processing is required, such as generating multiple variations of a dataset, the system must be capable of handling large-scale batch processing. Again, a distributed computing framework such as Apache Spark may be necessary for efficient data processing.\nFinally, cloud-based solutions like AWS, Google Cloud Platform, or Azure can offer scalability by providing resources on demand. They can easily scale up or down based on the system\u2019s requirements, making them a popular choice for highly scalable generative AI systems.\nSecurity\nEvery end user wants their data to be secure. When forming tech stacks, selecting high-security technologies is important, especially when it comes to online payments.\n\nHere is how the need for security can impact the choice of technology:\n\nGenerative AI systems are often trained on large datasets, some of which may contain sensitive information. As a result, data security is a significant concern. Choosing a tech stack with built-in security features such as encryption, access controls, and data masking can help mitigate the risks associated with data breaches.\nThe models used in generative AI systems are often a valuable intellectual property that must be protected from theft", "doc_id": "b46cc7e0-072b-48e8-a2d1-d64169a6fdbe", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "7e2796407e8bbbd74279a683bca4049a90deed5622647c3e27ce95911d323663", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 297307, "end": 314969}, "relationships": {"1": "d9152908-bd15-4715-85df-a4e7536a87b3", "2": "f4bf6058-801e-4c51-b4b3-8df7f57b12e2", "3": "16862b5b-d462-4941-93ef-25d8daf9a7e1"}, "__type__": "1"}, "16862b5b-d462-4941-93ef-25d8daf9a7e1": {"text": "can offer scalability by providing resources on demand.

It has various applications in different domains, from content creation and marketing to healthcare, software development and finance. Applications powered by generative AI models can automate tedious and repetitive tasks in a business environment, showcasing intelligent decision-making skills. Whether chatbots, virtual assistants, or predictive analytics apps, generative AI revolutionizes businesses\u2019 operations.\n\nIt is, however, challenging to create models that can produce output that is both coherent and contextually relevant in generative AI applications. Pre-trained models emerge as a powerful solution to this issue. Because they are trained on massive amounts of data, pre-trained language models can generate text similar to human language. But there may be situations where pre-trained models do not perform optimally for a particular application or domain. A pre-trained model needs to be fine-tuned in this situation.\n\nThe fine-tuning process involves updating pre-trained models with new information or data to help them adapt to specific tasks or domains. During the process of fine-tuning, the model is trained on a specific set of data to customize it to a particular use case. As generative AI applications have grown in popularity, fine-tuning has become an increasingly popular technique to enhance pre-trained models\u2019 performance.\n\nWhat are pre-trained models?\nPopular pre-trained models for generative AI applications\nWhat is fine-tuning a pre-trained model?\nHow does fine-tuning pre-trained models work?\nUnderstanding fine-tuning with an example\nHow to fine-tune a pre-trained model?\nBenefits of fine-tuning pre-trained models for generative AI applications\nWhat generative AI development services does LeewayHertz offer?\nWhat are pre-trained models?\nThe term \u201cpre-trained models\u201d refers to models that are trained on large amounts of data to perform a specific task, such as natural language processing, image recognition, or speech recognition. Developers and researchers can use these models without having to train their own models from scratch since the models have already learned features and patterns from the data.\n\nIn order to achieve high accuracy, pre-trained models are typically trained on large, high-quality datasets using state-of-the-art techniques. When compared to training a model from scratch, these pre-trained models can save developers and researchers time and money. It enables smaller organizations or individuals with limited resources to achieve impressive performance levels without requiring much data.\n\nPopular pre-trained models for generative AI applications\nSome of the popular pre-trained models include:\n\nGPT-3 \u2013 Generative Pre-trained Transformer 3 is a cutting-edge model developed by OpenAI. It has been pre-trained on a large amount of text dataset to comprehend prompts entered in human language and generate human-like text. They can be efficiently fine-tuned for language-related tasks like translation, question-answering and summarization.\nDALL-E \u2013 DALL-E is a language model developed by OpenAI for generating images from textual descriptions. Having been trained on a large dataset of images and descriptions, it can generate images that match the input descriptions.\nBERT \u2013 Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers or BERT is a language model developed by Google and can be used for various tasks, including question answering, sentiment analysis, and language translation. It has been trained on a large amount of text data and can be fine-tuned to handle specific language tasks.\nStyleGAN \u2013 Style Generative Adversarial Network is another generative model developed by NVIDIA that generates high-quality images of animals, faces and other objects.\nVQGAN + CLIP \u2013 This generative model, developed by EleutherAI, combines a generative model (VQGAN) and a language model (CLIP) to generate images based on textual prompts. With the help of a large dataset of images and textual descriptions, it can produce high-quality images matching input prompts.\nWhat is fine-tuning a pre-trained model?\nThe fine-tuning technique is used to optimize a model\u2019s performance on a new or different task. It is used to tailor a model to meet a specific need or domain, say cancer detection, in the field of healthcare. Pre-trained models are fine-tuned by training them on large amounts of labeled data for a certain task, such as Natural Language Processing (NLP) or image classification. Once trained, the model can be applied to similar new tasks or datasets with limited labeled data by fine-tuning the pre-trained model.\n\nThe fine-tuning process is commonly used in transfer learning, where a pre-trained model is used as a starting point to train a new model for a contrasting but related task. A pre-trained model can significantly diminish the labeled data required to train a new model, making it an effective tool for tasks where labeled data is scarce or expensive.\n\nHow does fine-tuning pre-trained models work?\nFine-tuning a pre-trained model works by updating the parameters utilizing the available labeled data instead of starting the training process from the ground up. The following are the generic steps involved in fine-tuning:\n\nLoading the pre-trained model: The initial phase in the process is to select and load the right model, which has already been trained on a large amount of data, for a related task.\nModifying the model for the new task: Once a pre-trained model is loaded, its top layers must be replaced or retrained to customize it for the new task. Adapting the pre-trained model to new data is necessary because the top layers are often task specific.\nFreezing particular layers: The earlier layers facilitating low-level feature extraction are usually frozen in a pre-trained model. Since these layers have already learned general features that are useful for various tasks, freezing them may allow the model to preserve these features, avoiding overfitting the limited labeled data available in the new task.\nTraining the new layers: With the labeled data available for the new task, the newly created layers are then trained, all the while keeping the weights of the earlier layers constant. As a result, the model\u2019s parameters can be adapted to the new task, and its feature representations can be refined.\nFine-tuning the model: Once the new layers are trained, you can fine-tune the entire model on the new task using the available limited data.\nHow does fine-tuning pre-trained models work\nUnderstanding fine-tuning with an example\nSuppose you have a pre-trained model trained on a wide range of medical data or images that can detect abnormalities like tumors and want to adapt the model for a specific use case, say identifying a rare type of cancer, but you have a limited set of labeled data available. In such a case, you must fine-tune the model by adding new layers on top of the pre-trained model and training the newly added layers with the available data. Typically, the earlier layers of a pre-trained model, which extract low-level features, are frozen to prevent overfitting.\n\nHow to fine-tune a pre-trained model?\nFine-tuning a pre-trained model involves the following steps:\n\nChoosing a pre-trained model\nThe first step in fine-tuning a pre-trained model involves selecting the right model. While choosing the model, ensure the pre-trained model you opt for suits the generative AI task you intend to perform. Here, we would be moving forward with OpenAI base models (Ada, Babbage, Curie and Davinci) to fine-tune and incorporate them into our application. If you are confused about which OpenAI model to select for your right use case, you can refer to the comparison table below:\n\nAda\tBabbage\tCurie\tDavinci\nPre-trained dataset\tInternet text\tInternet text\tInternet text\tInternet text\nParameters\t1.2 billion\t6 billion\t13 billion\t175 billion\nReleased date\t2020\t2020\t2021\t2021\nCost\tLeast costly\tLower cost than Curie\tLower cost than Davinci\tMost costly\nCapability\tCan perform well if given more context\tMore capable than Ada, but less efficient\tCan execute tasks that Ada or Babbage can do\tCan perform any tasks the other models do with fewer instructions\nTasks it can perform\tApt for less nuanced tasks, like reformatting and parsing text or simple classification tasks\tMost suited for semantic search tasks.

Run the following command to install it:\n\npip install --upgrade openai\nTo set your OPENAI_API_KEY environment variable, you can add the following line to your shell initialization script (such as .bashrc, zshrc, etc.) or run it in the command line before executing the fine-tuning command.\n\nexport OPENAI_API_KEY=\"<OPENAI_API_KEY>\"\nData preparation\nBefore fine-tuning the model, preparing the data corresponding to your particular use case is crucial. The raw data cannot be directly fed into the model as it requires filtering, formatting and pre-processing into a specific format. The data needs to be organized and arranged systemically so the model can interpret and analyze the data easily.\n\nFor our application, the data must be transformed into JSONL format, where each line represents a training example of a prompt-completion pair. You can utilize OpenAI\u2019s CLI data preparation tool to convert your data into this file format efficiently.\n\n{\"prompt\": \"<prompt text>\", \"completion\": \"<ideal generated text>\"}\n{\"prompt\": \"<prompt text>\", \"completion\": \"<ideal generated text>\"}\n{\"prompt\": \"<prompt text>\", \"completion\": \"<ideal generated text>\"}\n...\nCLI data preparation tool\nOpenAI\u2019s CLI data preparation tool validates, provides suggestions and reformats your data. Run the following command:\n\nopenai tools fine_tunes.prepare_data -f <LOCAL_FILE>\nA JSONL file can be generated from any type of file, whether a CSV, JSON, XLSX, TSV or JSONL file. Ensure that a prompt and completion key/column is included.\n\nDevelop a fine-tuned model\nOnce you have prepared and pre-processed the training data and converted it into JSONL file, you can begin the fine-tuning process utilizing the OpenAI CLI:\n\nopenai api fine_tunes.create -t <TRAIN_FILE_ID_OR_PATH> -m <BASE_MODEL>\nIn the above command, the \u2018BASE_MODEL\u2019 should be the name of the base model you chose, be it Babbage, Curie, Ada or Davinci. The above commands result in the following things:\n\nDevelops a fine-tuned job.\nUploads the file utilizing the files API or avails an already-uploaded file.\nEvents are streamed until the task is complete.\nOnce you begin the fine-tuning job, it takes some time to complete. Depending on the size of your dataset and model, your job may be queued behind other jobs in our system. If the streaming of the event is interrupted due to any reason, you can run the following command to resume it:\n\nopenai api fine_tunes.follow -i <YOUR_FINE_TUNE_JOB_ID>\nAfter the job is completed, it will display the name of the fine-tuned model.\n\nUse a fine-tuned model\nWhen you successfully develop a fine-tuned model, the field, \u2018FINE_TUNED_MODEL\u2019, will print the name of your customized model, for example, \u201ccurie:ft-personal-2023-03-01-11-00-50.\u201d You can specify this model as a parameter for OpenAI\u2019s Completions API and utilize Playground to submit requests.\n\nThe model may not be ready to handle requests immediately after your job completes. It is likely that your model is still being loaded if completion requests time out. In this case, try again later.\n\nTo begin making requests, include the model\u2019s name as the \u2018model\u2019 parameter in a completion request.\nHere\u2019s an example using OpenAI CLI:\n\nopenai api completions.create -m <FINE_TUNED_MODEL> -p <YOUR_PROMPT>\nThe code snippet using Python may look like this:\n\nimport openai\nopenai.Completion.create(\nmodel=FINE_TUNED_MODEL,\nprompt=YOUR_PROMPT)\nIn the above code, other than the \u2018model\u2019 and \u2018prompt,\u2019 you can also use other completion parameters like \u2018frequency_penalty,\u2019 \u2018max_tokens,\u2019 \u2018temperature,\u2019 \u2018presence_penalty,\u2019 and so on.\n\nValidation\nOnce the model is fine-tuned, run the fine-tuned model on a separate validation dataset to assess its performance. To perform validation, you must reserve some data before fine-tuning the model. The reserved data should have the same format as the training data and be mutually exclusive. Including a validation file in the fine-tuning process allows for periodic evaluations of the model\u2019s performance against the validation data.\n\nopenai api fine_tunes.create -t <TRAIN_FILE_ID_OR_PATH> \\\n-v <VALIDATION_FILE_ID_OR_PATH> \\\n-m <MODEL>\nBy performing this step, you can identify any potential issues and fine-tune the model further to make it more accurate.\n\nBenefits of fine-tuning pre-trained models for generative AI applications\nFine-tuning a pre-trained model for generative AI applications promises the following benefits:\n\nAs pre-trained models are already trained on a large amount of data, it eliminates the need to train a model from scratch, saving time and resources.\nFine-tuning facilitates customization of the pre-trained model to industry-specific use cases, which improves performance and accuracy. It is especially useful for niche applications that require domain-specific data or specialized knowledge.\nAs pre-trained models have already learned the underlying patterns in the data, fine-tuning them can make them easier to identify and interpret the output.\nWhat generative AI development services does LeewayHertz offer?\nLeewayHertz is an expert generative AI development company with over 15 years of experience and a team of 250+ full-stack developers.

With generative AI, computers can detect the underlying patterns in the input and produce similar content, unlocking new levels of creativity and innovation. Various techniques make generative AI possible, including transformers, generative adversarial networks (GANs), and variational auto-encoders. Transformers such as GPT-3, LaMDA, Wu-Dao, and ChatGPT mimic cognitive attention and measure the significance of input data parts. They are trained to understand language or images, learn classification tasks, and generate texts or images from massive datasets.\n\nHow to build a generative AI solution\nGANs consist of two neural networks: a generator and a discriminator that work together to find equilibrium between the two networks. The generator network generates new data or content resembling the source data, while the discriminator network differentiates between the source and generated data to recognize what is closer to the original data. Variational auto-encoders utilize an encoder to compress the input into code, which is then used by the decoder to reproduce the initial information. This compressed representation stores the input data distribution in a much smaller dimensional representation, making it an efficient and powerful tool for generative AI.\n\nGAN architecture\nSome potential benefits of generative AI include\n\nHigher efficiency: You can automate business tasks and processes using generative AI, freeing resources for more valuable work.\nCreativity: Generative AI can generate novel ideas and approaches humans might not have otherwise considered.\nIncreased productivity: Generative AI helps automate tasks and processes to help businesses increase their productivity and output.\nReduced costs: Generative AI is potentially leading to cost savings for businesses by automating tasks that would otherwise be performed by humans.\nImproved decision-making: By helping businesses analyze vast amounts of data, generative AI allows for more informed decision-making.\nPersonalized experiences: Generative AI can assist businesses in delivering more personalized experiences to their customers, enhancing the overall customer experience.\nGenerative AI application areas\nIt\u2019s time to recognize the game-changing potential of generative AI!

For instance, AI-powered chatbots and other customer service tools improve the customer experience, while predictive maintenance systems reduce downtime and maintenance costs. The insights generated by AI ensure better decision-making and help enterprises gain a competitive advantage.\n\nThis article discusses what an enterprise AI solution is, the four major advancements that set the stage for enterprise AI solutions, and some potential benefits of building an enterprise AI solution. Finally, we will discuss eight detailed steps to build an enterprise AI solution.\n\nWhat is an enterprise AI application?\nMajor advancements that laid the road for enterprise AI applications\nThe enterprise AI architecture: What does it entail?\nThe potential benefits of building an enterprise AI solution\nHow to build an enterprise AI solution?\nWhat is an enterprise AI solution?\n\nAn enterprise AI solution is an AI-based technology that is designed and implemented to solve specific business challenges or streamline business processes within an enterprise or organization. It involves the application of machine learning, natural language processing, computer vision, and other AI techniques to develop intelligent systems that can automate tasks, analyze data, and provide insights.\n\nEnterprise AI solutions can be customized to meet the unique needs of different organizations, and they can be used in various industries, including healthcare, finance, manufacturing, retail, and more. They can be used to improve customer experience, increase operational efficiency, reduce costs, and help organizations make data-driven decisions. Now, let\u2019s also discuss what an enterprise AI application is.\n\nAn enterprise AI application is a software application that leverages artificial intelligence (AI) technologies to improve business processes and decision-making within an enterprise setting. Some common examples of enterprise AI applications include customer service chatbots that understand and respond to customer inquiries in real-time, fraud detection systems that analyze transaction data and identify potential fraudulent activity, predictive maintenance systems, and supply chain optimization tools that optimize inventory levels and reduce transportation costs.\n\nMajor advancements that laid the road for enterprise AI solutions\nThe significance of enterprise AI cannot be overemphasized. As stated earlier, businesses can improve operational efficiency, automate routine tasks, and provide better customer experiences using enterprise AI solutions. Thus, it is easy to infer that businesses that embrace it will be best positioned to succeed in the future. But what were the driving forces behind this breakthrough? Taking a deep dive into the critical technological advancements that underpin enterprise AI development will give a well-rounded perspective on the technology\u2019s capabilities and potential impact.\n\nThe first of these advancements is the emergence of machine learning as a subfield of AI. ML enables machines to learn from data to perform certain tasks and functions without being explicitly programmed to do so. Machine learning systems don\u2019t need a list of set rules to make decisions but instead learn patterns from past training data. ML systems are highly diverse and adapt quickly to changing conditions, business requirements, and circumstances as their underlying training data evolve. ML systems have proven to outperform rules-based software across a variety of business use cases, such as in medical diagnostics, operational reliability, customer churn detection, and demand forecasting.\n\nThe second major advancement for enterprise AI solutions is the availability of vast amounts of digital data across enterprises instead of paper-based data. The success of Enterprise AI will remain dictated by the quantity, quality, and scope of data to which firms have access. Several AI solutions rely on supervised learning, which requires accurately labeled data. In cases where we use unsupervised learning for anomaly detection, the more data we have, the more accurate our results can be. Since AI and ML systems learn from historical data, the performance of these systems increases dramatically with the availability of higher volumes and a more diverse data set. With this rapid increase in available data volumes and the dramatic expansion in the variety of data sources, AI and machine learning systems are set to succeed across enterprise-grade use cases.\n\nThe third advancement has been the widespread adoption of IoT sensors across all major industries, from energy, infrastructure, manufacturing, and telecommunications to logistics, retail and healthcare. Owing to the vast number of sensors deployed across value chains, organizations can now have real-time visibility and insights across operations, supply chains, and customer service. While it may be difficult to monitor and act on this vast amount of real-time data manually or with rules-based software, enterprise AI solutions can make this feasible for us. This feature can unlock significant benefits for organizations across use cases such as predictive maintenance, quality control, operational safety, logistics management and fraud monitoring.\n\nThe next major advancement has been the emergence of the elastic cloud. AI and ML systems imbibe and improve their decision making through training. Training an ML model is finding an optimal set of model weights and parameters that best represent the relationship between the inputs and outputs observed in the training data. While the performance of the model improves significantly with an increase in the size of the training dataset and the number of training iterations, demand for storage resources needed for training can become material. Since a single enterprise AI solution may include thousands of ML models, each requiring consistent re-training, the need for storage resources can grow rapidly. The availability of elastic, cloud-based, and distributed computing and storage systems at a minimal cost addresses the model training challenge and is a major enabler for enterprise AI solutions. The elastic cloud provides managed services for running AI applications, eliminating organizations\u2019 need to manage the underlying infrastructure and freeing up IT resources for other tasks. Additionally, it integrates with the Elastic Stack, which provides a comprehensive set of data analysis and visualization tools, making it easier for organizations to gain valuable insights from their AI applications and make data-driven decisions.\n\nUnleash the Potential of AI for Your Enterprise with Our Expert App Development Services\nLaunch your project with LeewayHertz\n\nLearn More\nThe enterprise AI architecture: What does it entail?\nThe design, structure and solutions offered by AI systems together make the enterprise AI architecture.

Whether text-generating ChatGPT or image-generating Midjourney, generative AI tools have transformed businesses and dominated the content creation industry. With Microsoft\u2019s partnership with OpenAI and Google creating its own AI-powered chatbot called Bard, it is fast growing into one of the hottest areas within the tech sphere.\n\nGenerative AI aims to generate new data similar to the training dataset. It utilizes machine learning algorithms called generative models to learn the patterns and distributions underlying the training data. Although different generative models are available that produce text, images, audio, codes and videos, this article will take a deep dive into generative video models.\n\nFrom generating video using text descriptions to generating new scenes and characters and enhancing the quality of a video, generative video models offer a wealth of opportunities for video content creators. Generative video platforms are often powered by sophisticated models like GANs, VAEs, or CGANs, capable of translating human language to build images and videos. In this article, you will learn about generative video models, their advantages, and how they work, followed by a step-by-step guide on creating your own generative video model\n\nGenerative models and their types\nWhat is a generative video model?\nWhat tasks can a generative video model perform?\nBenefits of generative video models\nHow do generative video models work?\nHow to create a generative video model?\nGenerative models and their types\nGenerative models create new data similar to the training data using machine learning algorithms. To create new data, these models undergo a series of training wherein they are exposed to large datasets. They learn the underlying patterns and relationships in the training data to produce similar synthetic data based on their knowledge acquired from the training. Once trained, these models take text prompts (sometimes image prompts) to generate content based on the text.\n\nThere are several different types of generative models, including:\n\nGenerative Adversarial Networks (GANs): GANs are based on a two-part model, where one part, called the generator, generates fake data, and the other, the discriminator, evaluates the fake data\u2019s authenticity. The generator\u2019s goal is to produce fake data that is so convincing that the discriminator cannot tell the difference between fake and real data.\nStable Diffusion Models (SDMs): SDMs, also known as Flow-based Generative Models, transform a simple random noise into more complex and structured data, like an image or a video. They do this by defining a series of simple transformations, called flows, that gradually change the random noise into the desired data.\nAutoregressive Models: Autoregressive models generate data one piece at a time, such as generating one word in a sentence at a time. They do this by predicting the next piece of data based on the previous pieces.\nVariational Autoencoders (VAEs): VAEs work by encoding the training data into a lower-dimensional representation, known as a latent code, and then decoding the latent code back into the original data space to generate new data.

The choice of which model to use will depend on the specific requirements of the task at hand.\n\nWhat is a generative video model?\nGenerative video models are machine learning algorithms that generate new video data based on patterns and relationships learned from training datasets. In these models, the underlying structure of the video data is learned, allowing it to be used to create synthetic video data similar to the original ones. Different types of generative video models are available, like GANs, VAEs, CGANs and more, each of which takes a different training approach based on its unique infrastructure.\n\nGenerative video models mostly utilize text-to-video prompts where users can enter their requirements through text, and the model generates the video using the textual description. Depending on your tools, generative video models also utilize sketch or image prompts to generate videos.\n\nWhat tasks can a generative video model perform?\nA wide range of activities can be carried out by generative video models, including:\n\nVideo synthesis: Generative video models can be used to create new video frames to complete a sequence that has only been partially completed. This can be handy for creating new video footage from still photographs or replacing the missing frames in a damaged movie.\nVideo style transfer: Transferring one video style to another using generative video models enables the creation of innovative and distinctive visual effects. For instance, to give a video a distinct look, the style of a well-known artwork could be applied.\nVideo compression: Generative video models can be applied to video compression, which comprises encoding the original video into a lower-dimensional representation and decoding it to produce a synthetic video comparable to the original. Doing this makes it possible to compress video files without compromising on quality.\nVideo super resolution: By increasing the resolution of poor-quality videos, generative video models can make them seem sharper and more detailed.\nVideo denoising: Noise can be removed using generative video models to make video data clearer and simpler to watch.\nVideo prediction: To do real-time video prediction tasks like autonomous driving or security monitoring, generative video models can be implemented to forecast the next frames in a video. Based on the patterns and relationships discovered from the training data, the model can interpret the currently playing video data and produce the next frames.\nBenefits of generative video models\nCompared to more conventional techniques, generative video models have a number of benefits:\n\nEfficiency: Generative video models can be taught on massive datasets of videos and images to produce new videos quickly and efficiently in real time. This makes it possible to swiftly and affordably produce large volumes of fresh video material.\nCustomization: With the right adjustments, generative video models can produce video material that is adapted to a variety of needs, including style, genre, and tone. This enables the development of video content with more freedom and flexibility.\nDiversity: Generative video models can produce a wide range of video content, including original scenes and characters and videos created from text descriptions. This opens up new channels for the production and dissemination of video content.\nData augmentation: Generative video models can produce more training data for computer vision and machine learning models, which can help these models perform better and become more resilient to changes in the distribution of the data.\nNovelty: Generative video models can produce innovative and unique video content that is still related to the training data creating new possibilities for investigating novel forms of storytelling and video content.\nHow do generative video models work?\nLike any other AI model, generative video models are trained on large data sets to produce new videos. However, the training process varies from model to model depending on the model\u2019s architecture. Let us understand how this may work by taking the example of two different models: VAE and GAN.\n\nVariational Autoencoders (VAEs)\nA Variational Autoencoder (VAE) is a generative model for generating videos and images. In a VAE, two main components are present: an encoder and a decoder. An encoder maps a video to a lower-dimensional representation, called a latent code, while a decoder reverses the process.\n\nA VAE uses encoders and decoders to model the distribution of videos in training data. In the encoder, each video is mapped into a latent code, which becomes a parameter for parametrizing a probability distribution (such as a normal distribution). To calculate a reconstruction loss, the decoder maps the latent code back to a video, then compares it to the original video.\n\nTo maximize the diversity of the generated videos, the VAE encourages the latent codes to follow the prior distribution, which minimizes the reconstruction loss. After the VAE has been trained, it can be leveraged to generate new videos by sampling latent codes from a prior distribution and passing them through the decoder.\n\nGenerative Adversarial Networks (GANs)\nGANs are deep learning model that generates images or videos when given a text prompt. A GAN has two core components: a generator and a discriminator. Both the generator and the discriminator, being neural networks, process the video input to generate different kinds of output. While the generator generates fake videos, the discriminator assesses these videos\u2019 originality to provide feedback to the generator.\n\nUsing a random noise vector as input, the generator in the GAN generates a video. Discriminators take in videos as input and produce probability scores indicating the likelihood of the video is real. Here, the generator classifies the videos as real if taken from the training data and the video generated by the generator is stamped as fake.\n\nGenerators and discriminators have trained adversarially during training. Generators are trained to create fake videos that discriminators cannot detect, while discriminators are trained to identify fake videos created by generators. The generator continues this process until it produces videos that the discriminator can no longer distinguish from actual videos.\n\nFollowing the training process, a noise vector can be sampled and passed through the generator to generate a brand-new video. While incorporating some randomness and diversity, the resultant videos should reflect the characteristics of the training data.\nGAN Model work\n \n\nBuild Your Own Cutting-Edge Generative Video Model with Our AI Development Services\nLaunch your project with LeewayHertz\n\nLearn More\nHow to create a generative video model?\nHere, we discuss how to create a generative video model similar to the VToonify framework that combines the advantages of StyleGAN and Toonify frameworks.\n\nSet up the environment\nThe first step to creating a generative video model is setting up the environment. To set up the environment for creating a generative video model, you must decide on the right programming language to write codes. Here, we are moving forward with Python. Next, you must install several software packages, including a deep learning framework such as TensorFlow or PyTorch, and any additional libraries you will need to preprocess and visualize your data.\n\nInstall the following dependencies:\nA deep learning framework like PyTorch, Keras or TensorFlow. For this tutorial, we are using PyTorch. To install, run the following command:\npip install torch torchvision\nInstall Anaconda and CUDA toolkit based on your system.\nAdditional libraries that match your project requirements. We need the given libraries to create a generative video model.\nNumPy:\npip install numpy\nOpenCV:\npip install opencv-python\nMatplotlib:\npip install matplotlib\nOther necessary dependencies can be found here.You may need to modify the file \u2018vtoonify_env.yaml\u2018 to install PyTorch that matches with your own CUDA version.\n\nSet up a GPU environment for faster training. You can utilize cloud services like Google Cloud Platform (GCP) or Amazon Web Services (AWS)\nTo train the model, obtain a dataset of images or video clips. Here, we are using this dataset to train the model.\nModel architecture design\nYou cannot create a generative video model without designing the architecture of the model. It determines the quality and capacity of the generated video sequences. Considering the sequential nature of video data is critical when designing the architecture of the generative model since video sequences consist of multiple frames linked by time. Combining CNNs with RNNs or creating a custom architecture may be an option.\n\nAs we are designing a model similar to VToonify, understanding in-depth about the framework is necessary. So, what is VToonify?\n\nVToonify is a framework developed by MMLab@NTU for generating high-quality artistic portrait videos. It combines the advantages of two existing frameworks: the image translation framework and the StyleGAN-based framework. The image translation framework supports variable input size, but achieving high-resolution and controllable style transfer is difficult. On the other hand, the StyleGAN-based framework is good for high-resolution and controllable style transfer but is limited to fixed image size and may lose details.\n\nVToonify uses the StyleGAN model to achieve high-resolution and controllable style transfer and removes its limitations by adapting the StyleGAN architecture into a fully convolutional encoder-generator architecture. It uses an encoder to extract multi-scale content features of the input frame and combines them with the StyleGAN model to preserve the frame details and control the style. The framework has two instantiations, namely, VToonify-T and VToonify-D, wherein the first uses Toonify and the latter follows DualStyleGAN.\n\nThe backbone of VToonify-D is DualStyleGAN, developed by MMLab@NTU. DualStyleGAN utilizes the benefits of StyleGAN and can be considered an advanced version of it. In this article, we will be moving forward with VToonify-D.\n\nThe following steps need to be considered while designing a model architecture:\n\nDetermine the input and output data format.\nSince the model we develop is VToonify-like, human face sequences should be fed as input to the generative model, and anime or cartoon face sequences should be the output. Images, optical flows, or feature maps can be input and output data formats.\n\nFor your base architecture, choose StyleGAN, which utilizes the GAN model to give the desired outcome.\nAdd the encoder-generator networks.\nWrite the following codes for the encoder network:\n\nnum_styles = int(np.log2(out_size)) * 2 - 2\nencoder_res = [2**i for i in range(int(np.log2(in_size)), 4, -1)]\nself.encoder = nn.ModuleList()\nself.encoder.append(\nnn.Sequential(\nnn.Conv2d(img_channels+19, 32, 3, 1, 1, bias=True),\nnn.LeakyReLU(negative_slope=0.2, inplace=True),\nnn.Conv2d(32, channels[in_size], 3, 1, 1, bias=True),\nnn.LeakyReLU(negative_slope=0.2, inplace=True)))\nfor res in encoder_res:\nin_channels = channels[res]\nif res > 32:\nout_channels = channels[res // 2]\nblock = nn.Sequential(\nnn.Conv2d(in_channels, out_channels, 3, 2, 1, bias=True),\nnn.LeakyReLU(negative_slope=0.2, inplace=True),\nnn.Conv2d(out_channels, out_channels, 3, 1, 1, bias=True),\nnn.LeakyReLU(negative_slope=0.2, inplace=True))\nself.encoder.append(block)\nelse:\nlayers = []\nfor _ in range(num_res_layers):\nlayers.append(VToonifyResBlock(in_channels))\nself.encoder.append(nn.Sequential(*layers))\nblock = nn.Conv2d(in_channels, img_channels, 1, 1, 0, bias=True)\nself.encoder.append(block)\nYou can refer to this GitHub link to add the generator network.\n\nModel training\nFirst, you need to import argparse, math and random to start training the model. Run the following commands to do so:\n\nimport argparse\nimport math\nimport random\nAfter importing all prerequisites, specify the parameters for training. It includes total training iterations, the batch size for each GPU, the local rank for distributed training, the interval of saving a checkpoint, the learning rate and more. You can refer to the following command lines to understand.\n\nself.parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(description=\"Train VToonify-D\")\nself.parser.add_argument(\"--iter\", type=int, default=2500, help=\"total training iterations\")\nself.parser.add_argument(\"--batch\", type=int, default=9, help=\"batch sizes for each gpus\")\nself.parser.add_argument(\"--lr\", type=float, default=0.0001, help=\"learning rate\")\nself.parser.add_argument(\"--local_rank\", type=int, default=0, help=\"local rank for distributed training\")\nself.parser.add_argument(\"--start_iter\", type=int, default=0, help=\"start iteration\")\nself.parser.add_argument(\"--save_every\", type=int, default=25000, help=\"interval of saving a checkpoint\")\nself.parser.add_argument(\"--save_begin\", type=int, default=35000, help=\"when to start saving a checkpoint\")\nself.parser.add_argument(\"--log_every\", type=int, default=300, help=\"interval of saving a checkpoint\")\nNext, we have to pre-train the encoder network for the model.\n\ndef pretrain(args, generator, g_optim, g_ema, parsingpredictor, down, directions, styles, device):\npbar = range(args.iter)\nif get_rank() == 0:\npbar = tqdm(pbar, initial=args.start_iter, dynamic_ncols=True, smoothing=0.01)\nrecon_loss = torch.tensor(0.0, device=device)\nloss_dict = {}\nif args.distributed:\ng_module = generator.module\nelse:\ng_module = generator\naccum = 0.5 ** (32 / (10 * 1000))\nrequires_grad(g_module.encoder, True)\nfor idx in pbar:\ni = idx + args.start_iter\nif i > args.iter:\nprint(\"Done!\")\nbreak\nNow train both the generator and the discriminator using paired data.\n\ndef train(args, generator, discriminator, g_optim, d_optim, g_ema, percept, parsingpredictor, down, pspencoder, directions, styles, device):\npbar = range(args.iter)\nif get_rank() == 0:\npbar = tqdm(pbar, initial=args.start_iter, smoothing=0.01, ncols=130, dynamic_ncols=False)\nd_loss = torch.tensor(0.0, device=device)\ng_loss =", "doc_id": "11ad4da3-5f1c-4daf-a1dc-bc8732dcd3f3", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "56dcafcb705993377c522918eb8b9fcdcdbe061b41ca935d4dfc068b27abc21e", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 427910, "end": 442709}, "relationships": {"1": "d9152908-bd15-4715-85df-a4e7536a87b3", "2": "8fe74f5a-96a6-4532-9480-dd41c361f211", "3": "192610f1-c30f-4c84-aa41-aecbb69e618c"}, "__type__": "1"}, "192610f1-c30f-4c84-aa41-aecbb69e618c": {"text": "True)\nfor idx in pbar:\ni = idx + args.start_iter\nif i > args.iter:\nprint(\"Done!\")\nbreak\nNow train both the generator and the discriminator using paired data.\n\ndef train(args, generator, discriminator, g_optim, d_optim, g_ema, percept, parsingpredictor, down, pspencoder, directions, styles, device):\npbar = range(args.iter)\nif get_rank() == 0:\npbar = tqdm(pbar, initial=args.start_iter, smoothing=0.01, ncols=130, dynamic_ncols=False)\nd_loss = torch.tensor(0.0, device=device)\ng_loss = torch.tensor(0.0, device=device)\ngrec_loss = torch.tensor(0.0, device=device)\ngfeat_loss = torch.tensor(0.0, device=device)\ntemporal_loss = torch.tensor(0.0, device=device)\ngmask_loss = torch.tensor(0.0, device=device)\nloss_dict = {}\nsurffix = '_s'\nif args.fix_style:\nsurffix += '%03d'%(args.style_id)\nsurffix += '_d'\nif args.fix_degree:\nsurffix += '%1.1f'%(args.style_degree)\nif not args.fix_color:\nsurffix += '_c'\nif args.distributed:\ng_module = generator.module\nd_module = discriminator.module\nelse:\ng_module = generator\nd_module = discriminator\nIn the above code snippet, the function \u2018train\u2019 establishes various loss tensors for the generator and the discriminator and generates a dictionary of loss values. Using the backpropagation algorithm, the algorithm loops over the specified number of iterations and calculates and minimizes losses.\n\nYou can find the whole set of codes to train the model here.\n\nModel evaluation and fine-tuning\nModel evaluation involves evaluating the model\u2019s quality, efficiency, and effectiveness. When developers evaluate a model carefully, they can identify areas for improvement and fine-tune its parameters to improve its functionality. This process involves accessing the quality of the generated video sequences using quantitative metrics such as structural similarity index (SSIM), Mean Squared Error (MSE) or peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) and visually inspecting the generated video sequences.\n\nBased on the evaluation results, fine-tune the model by adjusting the architecture, configuration, or training process to improve its performance. It would be best to optimize the hyperparameters, which involves adjusting the loss function, fine-tuning the optimization algorithm and tweaking the model\u2019s parameters to enhance the generative video model\u2019s performance.\n\nDevelop web UI\nBuilding a web User Interface (UI) is necessary if your project needs the end-users to interact with the video model. It enables users to feed input parameters like effects, style types, image rescale, style degree or more. For this, you must design the layout, topography, colors and other visual elements based on your set parameters.\n\nNow, develop the front end as per the design. Once the UI is developed, test it thoroughly to make it free of bugs and optimize the functionality. You can also use Gradio UI to build custom UI for the project without coding requirements.\n\nDeployment\nOnce the model is trained and fine-tuned and the web UI is built, the model needs to be deployed to a production environment for generating new videos. Integration with a mobile or web app, setting up a data processing and streaming pipeline, and configuring the hardware and software infrastructure may be required to deploy the model based on the requirement.\n\nWrapping up\nThe steps involved in creating a generative video model are complex and consist of preprocessing the video dataset and designing the model architecture to adding layers to the basic architecture and training and evaluating the model. Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) or Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) are frequently used as the foundation architecture, and the model\u2019s capacity and complexity can be increased by including Convolutional, Pooling, Recurrent, or Dense layers.\n\nThere are several applications for generative video models, such as video synthesis, video toonification, and video style transfer. Existing image-oriented models can be trained to produce high-quality, artistic videos with adaptable style settings. The field of generative video models is rapidly evolving, and new techniques and models are continually being developed to improve the quality and flexibility of the generated videos.\n\nFascinated by a generative video model\u2019s capabilities and want to leverage its power to level up your business?

Generative AI algorithms can create new music, images, code, simulations and even entire websites in a matter of seconds. AI-supported virtual assistants like Siri and Alexa use Generative AI algorithms to respond to queries and provide insightful information. The use of Generative AI leads to faster completion of content generation tasks, which offers benefits at both individual and organizational levels. As technology advances, Generative AI will likely become capable of handling even more complex tasks like putting together scientific papers or creating visual design mock-ups. Prominent Generative AI models like Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), Variational AutoEncoders (VAEs), Generative Pretrained Transformer 3 (GPT-3), and other similar generative AI models have been attracting a lot of attention in recent times. Diffusion models are generative deep learning models that learn the underlying data distribution of inputs through a controlled and steady diffusion process to produce high-quality and diverse outputs. The models offer solutions for several applications, such as text generation, audio processing, and image categorization.\n\nThis article discusses what a diffusion model is, its purpose, the different types of diffusion models, some key characteristics of diffusion processes, some factors affecting the diffusion process, and then deep dives into the process of training one. The article covers five detailed steps in training a diffusion model: data preparation, model selection, model training, model evaluation and implementation. Finally, we will look at what can be anticipated in future work on training diffusion models in machine learning.\n\nWhat is a diffusion model?\nWhat is the purpose of a diffusion model?\nWhat are the different types of diffusion models?\nWhat are some of the key characteristics of diffusion processes?\nWhat are some other factors affecting diffusion?\nHow to train a diffusion model?\nTraining diffusion models in machine learning: The future\nWhat is a diffusion model?\nIntroduced in 2015, diffusion models, also known as diffusion probabilistic models are a class of latent variable models. These are Markov chains trained using variational inference. The sole intention of a diffusion model is to imbibe the latent structure of a dataset by modeling a way where data points diffuse through the latent space. By learning to reverse the diffusion process, a neural network is able to denoise images blurred with Gaussian noise. Three examples of generic diffusion modeling frameworks used in computer vision are denoising diffusion probabilistic models, noise-conditioned score networks, and stochastic differential equations. Diffusion models can be applied to tasks such as image denoising, inpainting, super-resolution, and image generation. An example of a diffusion model is OpenAI\u2019s DALL-E 2, which would start with a random noise image and then, after having been trained to reverse the diffusion process on natural images, the model could generate new natural images. DALL-E 2 uses diffusion models for the model\u2019s prior, which produces an image embedding a text caption and the decoder that produces the final image.\n\nWhat is the purpose of a diffusion model?\nA diffusion model attempts to understand and simulate the dissemination of ideas, information, and innovations within a group over time. Through social networks, diffusion models can be used to study the movement of information to predict the acceptance of newer technologies and analyze the spread of diseases in epidemiology, among many other applications. Diffusion models can be used to make predictions about the future spread of information. The overarching purpose of a diffusion model is to provide an exhaustive understanding of the process of information circulation and its impact on people, which can, in turn, be useful in various fields and applications.\n\nWhat are the different types of diffusion models?\nIn the field of machine learning, some of the most commonly used diffusion models to study the spread of information or ideas within a populace include:\n\nSocial network embedding models\nThese models capture the underlying structure and relationships between individuals and learn a low-dimensional representation of individuals on the same social network. This representation can be used to predict the dissemination of information through the network. Some models that have been developed for social network embedding include but are not limited to DeepWalk, GraRep, Node2Vec and Struc2Vec.\n\nDeep generative models\nUsing deep neural networks, these models generate fabricated data that can then be used to study the diffusion of information. A generative model could be trained on real diffusion data and then employed to generate its own data with similar properties, which can eventually be used to study the workings of other diffusion models. Some examples of deep generative models include Variational Autoencoders (VAE), Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN), Autoregressive models (such as PixelCNN or PixelRNN) and Flow-based Generative Models (such as RealNVP or Glow).\n\nReinforcement learning models\nUsing reinforcement learning algorithms to study the spread of information through a network, these models have individual networks or agents, and the circulation of information is represented as a series of actions taken by these individual networks. Some examples of reinforcement learning models include Q-Learning, SARSA (State-Action-Reward-State-Action), Deep Q-Network (DQN), and Policy Gradients (PG).\n\nGraph convolutional networks\nThese models use graph convolutional networks to learn the structure of a social network and the relationships between individuals. The learned representations can then be used to predict the spread of information or ideas through the network. Some graph convolutional network models include Graph Attention Network (GAT), Chebyshev Graph Convolutional Network (ChebNet) and Spectral Graph Convolutional Network (SGC), among others.\n\nEach of these machine learning models has its own advantages and limitations, and the choice of model will depend on the specific application and the data available.\n\nBuild text-to-image and image-to-image generative AI models with Stable Diffusion-like capabilities\nLaunch your project with LeewayHertz\n\nLearn More\nWhat are some of the key characteristics of diffusion processes?\nNetwork structure\nThe dynamics between individuals play a significant role in the diffusion of data. Machine learning models can learn the structure of a network and make predictions about the dissemination of information.\n\nTemporal dynamics\nDiffusion processes evolve over time.

ML models can capture the temporal dynamics of diffusion, including the rate of spread and the time it takes for information to reach a group of individuals.\n\nHeterogeneity\nEach individual has their own characteristics, such as different levels of influence or different thresholds for adoption, which can then be used to make predictions about the spread of information.\n\nInfluence mechanisms\nThe spread of information can be influenced through word-of-mouth, marketing campaigns, and incentives. Machine learning models can capture these influence mechanisms, which can then be used to make predictions about the spread of information.\nFeedback loops: The spread of information can have feedback, with early adopters influencing the decisions of later adopters. Machine learning models can capture feedback loops in the diffusion process, which can then be used to make predictions about the spread of information.\n\nThese are some of the key characteristics of diffusion processes in machine learning, which provide a framework for modeling and understanding the spread of information within a population.\n\nWhat are some other factors affecting diffusion?\nSocial influence: The spread of information can be influenced by the decisions and behaviors of other members in the network. This can result in the magnification or dampening of information diffusion.\nInformation quality: The quality of the information being diffused can strongly impact the diffusion rate. Ill-designed or incorrect information may not diffuse as effectively as well-designed, correct information.\nTime and context: The diffusion of information can be influenced by the timing of the information and the specific context in which it is being diffused. For example, the diffusion rate may be faster in a crisis situation or slower in a context where the information is irrelevant.\nThese key factors provide a framework for understanding the complex processes that govern the spread of information within a population. Machine learning models can make more accurate predictions about the diffusion of information and help design more effective strategies for promoting or slowing down the spread of information by considering these factors.\n\nHow to train a diffusion model?\nStep 1: Data preparation\nData collection: This is an important step in training a diffusion model. The data used to train the model must correctly represent the structure of the network and the connections between individuals in the population, such as their demographic information or preferences for certain types of information.\n\nData cleaning and pre-processing: Once the data has been collected, it must be cleaned and pre-processed to ensure that it is suitable for use in training a diffusion model. This can involve removing absent or repeating data, dealing with outliers, or transforming the data into a suitable format for training.\n\nData transformation: Data transformation is the final step in data preparation for diffusion model training. The data may be converted into a graph format or scaled to ensure all variables have similar ranges. The choice of data transformation will depend on the specific requirements of the diffusion model being trained and the nature of the data being used.\n\nStep 2: Model selection\nComparison of different diffusion models in ML: Some commonly known types of diffusion models include threshold models, susceptible-infected (SI) models, and independent cascade models. The choice of a diffusion model depends on the customized requirements of the application. These can range from the size of the population or the complexity of the network structure to the type of diffusion being modeled.\n\nSelection criteria: When selecting a diffusion model for training, focus on the accuracy of the model, the computational efficiency of the model, the interpretability of the model, and the ability of the model to handle missing data. It may also be important to consider the availability of data and the ease of assimilating the model into an existing system.\n\nModel hyperparameters: These model parameters influence the performance and control the behavior of a diffusion model. The choice of hyperparameters will depend on the specific requirements of the application and the nature of the data being used. It is important to carefully tune the hyperparameters to ensure that the model is performing optimally.\n\nStep 3: Model training\nSplitting the data into training and test sets: The training set is used to train the model, while the test set is used to evaluate the performance of the model. It is important to ensure that the training and test sets represent the data as a whole and that they are not biased towards certain types of individuals or units.\n\nSetting the model parameters: This step includes setting the hyperparameters discussed in a previous section, as well as setting any other model parameters required for the specific type of diffusion model being used. It is important to set the model parameters carefully so that the model is able to learn the underlying structure of the data and prevent overfitting.\n\nTraining the model: Once the data has been split and the model parameters have been set, the final step is to train the model. The training process typically involves iterating over the training set multiple times and updating the model parameters based on the model\u2019s performance on the training set. The goal of the training process is to find a set of model parameters that accurately represent the relationships between individuals in the population and that generalize well to new data.\n\nThere are two implementations: conditional and unconditional.\n\nThe Model\n\nThe default non-conditional diffusion model is composed of a UNet with self-attention layers. We have the classic U structure with downsampling and upsampling paths. The main difference with traditional UNet is that the up and down blocks support an extra timestep argument on their forward pass. This is done by embedding the timestep linearly into the convolutions, for more details, check the modules.py file.\n\n\nclass UNet(nn.Module):\n    def __init__(self, c_in=3, c_out=3, time_dim=256):\n        super().__init__()\n        self.time_dim = time_dim\n        self.inc = DoubleConv(c_in, 64)\n        self.down1 = Down(64, 128)\n        self.sa1 = SelfAttention(128)\n        self.down2 = Down(128, 256)\n        self.sa2 = SelfAttention(256)\n        self.down3 = Down(256, 256)\n        self.sa3 = SelfAttention(256)\n        self.bot1 = DoubleConv(256, 256)\n        self.bot2 = DoubleConv(256, 256)\n        self.up1 = Up(512, 128)\n        self.sa4 = SelfAttention(128)\n        self.up2 = Up(256, 64)\n        self.sa5 = SelfAttention(64)\n        self.up3 = Up(128, 64)\n        self.sa6 = SelfAttention(64)\n        self.outc = nn.Conv2d(64, c_out, kernel_size=1)\n    def unet_forwad(self, x, t):\n        \"Classic UNet structure with down and up branches, self attention in between convs\"\n        x1 = self.inc(x)\n        x2 = self.down1(x1, t)\n        x2 = self.sa1(x2)\n        x3 = self.down2(x2, t)\n        x3 = self.sa2(x3)\n        x4 = self.down3(x3, t)\n        x4 = self.sa3(x4)\n        x4 = self.bot1(x4)\n        x4 = self.bot2(x4)\n        x = self.up1(x4, x3, t)\n        x = self.sa4(x)\n        x = self.up2(x, x2, t)\n        x = self.sa5(x)\n        x = self.up3(x, x1, t)\n        x = self.sa6(x)\n        output = self.outc(x)\n        return output\n    def forward(self, x, t):\n        \"Positional encoding of the timestep before the blocks\"\n        t = t.unsqueeze(-1)\n        t = self.pos_encoding(t, self.time_dim)\n        return self.unet_forwad(x, t)\nThe conditional model is almost identical but adds the encoding of the class label into the timestep by passing the label through an Embedding layer.

In this step, the model\u2019s predictions of the actual outcomes of the test set will be compared. Some performance metrics that can be used to evaluate the performance of a diffusion model include accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.\n\nInterpretation of model results: Evaluating the performance of the model includes your ability to interpret the results of the model. By understanding relationships between individuals in the population and how they influence the diffusion process, you are able to achieve this. This step may also involve identifying the most influential individuals in the population and the factors that contribute to their influence.\n\nModel refinement: Refining the model is crucial to improve its performance. The model\u2019s parameters may need adjusting, additional data may need to be collected, or the selection of a different type of diffusion model might be required at this stage. The end goal of this process is to ensure that the model accurately represents the relationships between individuals in the population and provides useful insights into the diffusion process. The refinement process may involve repeating the model training and evaluation steps multiple times until the desired level of performance is achieved.\n\n \n\nStep 5: Implementation\n\nDeployment of the trained model: Deployment refers to integrating the model into a production environment so that it can be used to make predictions on new data. Some methods include assimilating the model on a cloud platform, as a web service, or even as part of a larger software application.\n\nIntegration with other systems: Integration with other models can allow the deployed model to become part of a larger solution. The model can be integrated with a database, an API, or a user interface. The goal of integration is to ensure that the model works in tandem with the rest of the system and is also able to provide accurate predictions in real-time.\n\nOngoing maintenance and monitoring: Once the model has been deployed, it will need constant monitoring to function optimally and provide accurate predictions over time. Monitoring the model also includes adjusting the model parameters, retraining it with new data, or replacing it entirely if it is no longer effective.\n\n \n\nTraining diffusion models in machine learning: The future\nImproved accuracy of predictions: Developing new methods to enhance the accuracy of predictions made by diffusion models, such as employing more advanced algorithms or involving additional new data sources.\nDeveloping new models: Creating newer models that are designed to handle only certain types of data or problems, such as models for predicting the spread of infectious diseases. These models will also be more interpretable so that domain experts can better understand and validate their predictions.\nModel deployment in new domains: Exploring the use of diffusion models in new areas, such as finance or healthcare, to further demonstrate their potential and flexibility.\nIncorporating uncertainty: Placing uncertainty into the predictions made by diffusion models will make them look more trustworthy, robust and authentic.\nHybrid models: Diffusion models, along with other types of models, such as deep learning models or reinforcement learning models, can work together to bring about improved accuracy and versatility.\nConclusion\nML is an extremely dynamic arena, having revolutionized many fields and industries. It has the potential to change the way we live and work, and it will be interesting to see how it continues to develop in the coming times. Talking about training a diffusion model, it involves several steps, including choosing a diffusion model that is the right fit for the data, selecting the relevant parameters and hyperparameters, and training the model using the selected data. It is also important to evaluate the model\u2019s performance and make necessary adjustments to optimize its accuracy. Finally, the trained model should be deployed and integrated into a production environment for use. With the right intent, diffusion models can provide key insights and predictions in a wide range of applications.\n\nUnlock the power of AI with our custom stable diffusion services.

Due to their rigid structure, traditional machine learning models are ill-equipped to handle the dynamic nature of our rapidly changing world, particularly with the influx of data generated by the IoT and autonomous vehicles. The inability of these models to adapt to new data streams often limits the effectiveness of even cutting-edge machine learning methods. But with the advent of adaptive AI, this issue is being addressed. Adaptive AI, with its capability for continuous learning, provides a more flexible approach to machine learning by enabling models to evolve and adapt to changing data in real time. This helps to overcome the limitations of traditional machine learning and effectively tackle the challenges posed by our constantly evolving data landscape.\nContinuous learning is a powerful form of AI that continually builds knowledge and improves over time. This makes it a game-changer for a multitude of industries, as it represents a move away from static learning towards a more adaptive approach. Gartner has identified adaptive AI as one of the top 10 emerging trends for 2023, poised to take AI to new heights by enabling it to learn as it develops. It is predicted that businesses utilizing adaptive AI will outperform their competitors by 25%. In a note, Gartner also mentioned \u201cFlexibility and adaptability are now vital, as many businesses have learned during a recent health and climate crises,\u201d says Gartner distinguished VP Analyst Erick Brethenoux. \u201cAdaptive AI systems aim to continuously retrain models or apply other mechanisms to adapt and learn within runtime and development environments \u2014 making them more adaptive and resilient to change.\u201d\n\nThis article provides an overview of adaptive AI, possible business areas where you can use it and the steps to implement it in real-life business.\n\nWhat is adaptive AI?\nHow does adaptive AI work?\nWhy is adaptive AI critical for business growth?\nAdaptive AI use cases\nHow to implement adaptive AI?\nBest practices for implementing adaptive AI\nWhat is adaptive AI?\nAdaptive AI, which combines artificial intelligence with an advanced and responsive autonomous learning method, is the next evolutionary step. Systems that use adaptive AI can quickly adapt to changing circumstances, which was not possible during initial AI development. This is achieved by continuously retraining and learning models in runtime based on new information.

This allows it to respond better to changes and challenges and to achieve goals more effectively.\n\nWhat is adaptive AI\nTo understand the concept better, let\u2019s compare adaptive AI with the traditional machine learning model.\n\nConsider an object detection system to drive a self-driving vehicle. The car must be able to recognize pedestrians and cyclists to ensure safe operation. It does an amazing job by training its neural network with large numbers of samples. However, as new object categories are constantly emerging, including hoverboards and electric steps, the car is also expected to detect hoverboards and electric steps if we update our detection system with a sufficient number of representative images. However, there is a catch! With traditional machine learning models, our system would forget pedestrians and cyclists from the old task if we update the system with new data and leave them unidentified. This phenomenon is known as catastrophic forgetting within neural networks.\n\nThere comes adaptive AI with continuous learning, a sequential method that does not involve catastrophic forgetting. In this case, the neural network retains all concepts learned over time, so it is easy to recall what you have learned using data. You can store and revisit the information when you are ready to learn something new. Given that these data streams may not have a definitive endpoint, it is crucial to remember that they may never end, thereby avoiding the risk of catastrophic forgetting within our systems.\n\nHere is a brief comparison between adaptive AI and traditional AI:\n\nFeature\nAdaptive AI\nTraditional AI\nMaintenance\tRequires ongoing monitoring and maintenance to ensure the system continues learning and adapting to new information.\tRequires less maintenance, as the system does not change or adapt once it has been deployed.\nHuman Interaction\tRequired\tOptional or not required\nLearning\tOnline learning or continuous learning involves feeding data to the system and updating its model in real-time.\tBatch learning, where the system is trained on a fixed dataset and then deployed, with no further updates to its model.\nPerformance\tImproves over time\tFixed or degrades over time\nReal-World Application\tIdeal for dynamic and rapidly changing environments where the system must evolve and continuously provide value.\tSuitable for environments with stable and well-defined conditions, where the system\u2019s performance does not need to change over time.\nAdaptability\tHigh, able to adapt to new information and changing conditions.\tLow, limited to the performance capabilities determined by the fixed training dataset.\nScalability\tHigh\tLow\nImplementation\tDynamic and flexible\tStatic and inflexible\nDefinition\tAI systems that can adapt and improve their performance over time through continuous learning.\tAI systems that are trained on a fixed dataset and do not adapt to new information or changing conditions.\nUnleash the potential of adaptive AI for your business with our adaptive AI development services\nLaunch your project with LeewayHertz\n\nLearn More\nHow does adaptive AI work?\nAdaptive AI works based on continuous learning (CL), an essential step toward achieving AI. Continuous learning refers to the ability of a model to learn continuously using the stream of data, which means that a model can autonomously learn from new data and adapt to production. This is why it is also known as continuous AutoML or auto-adaptive learning. CL is a method that mimics human\u2019s ability to continuously acquire, refine and transfer knowledge and skill throughout their lives. Machine learning aims to create models in a production environment, whereas continuous learning allows us to use the data coming into the production environment and retrain the model using the new activity. For example, we are familiar with Netflix\u2019s highly-acclaimed recommender system for \u201cUp Next\u201d. The Netflix recommender system suggests a show right after the last episode ends. This type of model is necessary to be retrained as new movies, preferences and market trends change. Continuous learning is key to gaining high accuracy and retaining high-performing models. Data scientists find continuous learning is a great way to improve models\u2019 accuracy and performance. It also saves time in retraining by making models auto-adaptive.\n\nAdaptive AI working\nAutoML plays an essential component in the continuous learning process of adaptive AI. AutoML (Automated Machine Learning) refers to the process of automating the entire machine learning pipeline, from data preparation to model selection and deployment. The goal of AutoML is to remove the need for manual intervention, reduce the time and resources required for training models and improve the accuracy of machine learning models. AutoML does not have to be complicated meta-learning; instead, it is easy to use frameworks, hyperparameter optimization and open-source algorithms with AutoML. Transfer-learning might be a good option if you are working on a computer vision problem that allows you to use a variety of pre-trained models, which you can then use to retain the last layer of your network and then have your model deployed. For continuous learning, you can choose one of the pre-built models, such as VGG, Inception or ResNet. Also, specifying parameters for each model is essential.\n\nAfter the training, you will do model validations to verify that all models function properly. You can also choose the best model and then deploy it to production. In this case, the pipeline appears to be like a closed traditional machine learning pipeline where monitoring is added to the pipeline to apply continuous learning while connecting it back to the data.\n\nMonitoring will take place for predictions collected within the model deployment area. After the data has been monitored, you can clean it and label it as needed. However, closing the loop with no human labeling for things like forecasting or recommender systems will be possible. After clearing and labeling the data, we will move it back to the data for validation and training. The loop is closed in this case.\n\nYour models will learn continuously and adapt to new trends and data while improving the model\u2019s accuracy. Consequently, your application will perform better overall.\n\nWhy is adaptive AI critical for business growth?\nAdaptive AI combines agent-based design and AI techniques like reinforcement learning, allowing systems to adapt their learning patterns and behaviors to real-world changes while in production. It learns from past human and machine experiences and delivers better results in runtime environments. For example, the U.S. Army has developed a system that adapts to each learner\u2019s strengths using its learning system. It can tell what to teach, when to test, and how to measure progress while acting as a tutor and tailoring the learning to each student.\n\nAdaptive AI systems will ultimately open the door to new business models, products, services, and channels, breaking down silos, and eventually, they will be able to enable new ways of doing things.\n\nIn a nutshell, adaptive AI helps business growth in the following ways:\n\nIncreased efficiency and automation: Adaptive AI helps automate routine tasks and processes, freeing up employees\u2019 time and increasing productivity.\nImproved decision-making: Adaptive AI provides real-time insights and data-driven decision-making, eliminating the chances of human error.\nPersonalization and customization: Trained adaptive AI models understand individual customer preferences, enabling companies to offer personalized experiences and products.\nCompetitive advantage: Companies that adopt adaptive AI technology can gain a competitive edge by staying ahead of their competitors in terms of efficiency and innovation.\nIncreased customer satisfaction: Adaptive AI can help companies provide faster and more effective customer service, increasing customer satisfaction and loyalty.\nCost savings: Automation and improved decision-making can lead to cost savings, freeing up resources that can be invested in other business areas.\nBetter risk management: Adaptive AI can analyze data and predict potential risks, allowing companies to avoid potential problems proactively.\nDecision-making is an essential but more complex task for any company, making it necessary to have decision-intelligence systems that can exercise greater autonomy.

Having SMART (specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound) goals will help you evaluate your adaptive AI system progress and make necessary adjustments.\nAcquiring high-quality data free from errors, inconsistencies, and duplicates is essential to establish a robust adaptive AI system that will learn from this data and make predictions based on it. If the training data is of poor quality, the system cannot model the problem, leading to suboptimal performance. Besides, diversity in the training data is also important to ensure the system can learn from a wide range of examples while remaining generalized to new cases.

To handle this issue, it\u2019s important to implement detection methods for data distribution and update the system accordingly. This can be done using techniques such as online learning algorithms, which can continuously learn and adapt to new data as it becomes available. Another approach is regularly retraining the system on the latest data to ensure it is up-to-date, which could be combined with online learning algorithms to balance real-time adaptation while improving overall performance.\nImplementing an effective testing and validation framework is crucial for ensuring the accuracy and reliability of an adaptive AI system. This is essential to validate the performance of your system and identify any issues or bugs that may affect its accuracy and reliability. Hence, when implementing a testing and validation framework, it is important to use various testing methods, including unit, integration, and performance testing. While unit testing allows you to test individual system components to ensure they function correctly, integration testing validates the interaction between different system components. On the other hand, performance testing measures the system\u2019s efficiency and scalability. Using diverse test data that accurately represents the problem space is also important, including both normal and edge cases and any unexpected scenarios. Alongside, using a diverse range of test data allows you to validate the performance of your system under different conditions and identify any areas that need improvement.\nMonitoring the fairness and ethics of an adaptive AI system is critical to avoid any unforeseen harm or discrimination. For example, a biased AI system might discriminate against certain groups of people based on race, gender, or age resulting in unfair treatment or outcomes, such as denial of access to services or employment opportunities. To ensure the fairness and ethics of an adaptive AI system, it\u2019s important to monitor its decisions and outcomes to identify the signs of bias or discrimination. This can be done using fairness metrics, which measure how much the system treats different groups equally. In addition, it\u2019s important to regularly review the training data and algorithms used in the system to ensure they are free from biases and if necessary, remove any data that may contain biases. You can apply the algorithms designed to reduce the impact of biases in the training data. Finally, it\u2019s important to have clear and transparent policies aligning with how the system is designed, along with required measures to ensure its fairness and ethics. This allows stakeholders to understand the system\u2019s decision-making processes and provides accountability for any unfair or unethical outcomes.\nOne of the challenges of adaptive AI systems is that they are difficult to understand and interpret, as they constantly evolve and change in response to new data, leading to difficulties for stakeholders to understand the reasoning behind the system\u2019s decisions, resulting in a lack of trust and accountability. To address this, explainable AI (XAI) techniques are used to provide a clear and concise explanation of the system\u2019s decisions. XAI is a subfield of AI that focuses on developing transparent, understandable, and interpretable systems. For example, this can include visualizations of the system\u2019s internal workings, such as decision trees or heatmaps, or methods for generating natural language explanations of the system\u2019s decisions. Using XAI techniques helps build trust in the system, as stakeholders can see how it arrived at its decisions and understand its reasoning while providing greater transparency and accountability, as the system\u2019s decision-making processes can be audited and reviewed to ensure they are fair and ethical.\nWith the increasing use of AI systems, security becomes an alarming issue as they are prone to potential threats raised by malicious actors. For example, an attacker could try to manipulate the system\u2019s inputs causing it to make incorrect decisions or access sensitive information stored in the system. So, ensuring the robustness and security of an adaptive AI system is the need of the hour. So, it\u2019s important to assess the system thoroughly and implement security measures by applying security audits, penetration testing, and other security assessments.\nEndnote\nAdaptive AI transforms the landscape of ML with its complex system approach, allowing the AI to seek its goals while simultaneously learning the optimum path and adapting its learning methods to align with real-world scenarios in the most effective way. With its flexibility and continuous learning abilities, adaptive AI surpasses traditional AI while its usability in multiple areas fits into any business application seamlessly and transforms how businesses operate and compete. From increased efficiency and automation to better decision-making and personalization, the benefits of adaptive AI are far-reaching. By adopting this innovative technology, companies can gain a competitive edge,enhance customer satisfaction, achieve cost savings, and improve risk management and decision-making processes all at once. To conclude, in a world that is constantly advancing technologically, implementing adaptive AI is not just a choice but a necessity for growth and success. Don\u2019t fall behind, tap into the potential of adaptive AI today.\n\nWant to transform the way you do business with cutting-edge adaptive AI solutions?

The integration of GPT models into virtual assistants and chatbots boosts their capabilities, which has resulted in a surge in demand for GPT models. According to a report published by Allied Market Research, titled \u201cGlobal NLP Market,\u201d the global NLP market size was valued at $11.1 billion in 2020 and is estimated to reach $341.5 billion by 2030, growing at a CAGR of 40.9% from 2021 to 2030. Interestingly, the demand for GPT models are a major contributor to this growth.\n\nGPT models are a collection of deep learning-based language models created by the OpenAI team. Without supervision, these models can perform various NLP tasks like question-answering, textual entailment, text summarization, etc. These language models require very few or no examples to understand tasks. They perform equivalent to or even better than state-of-the-art models trained in a supervised fashion.\n\nThe most trained GPT model -GPT-3, has 175 billion learning parameters, making it ten times more powerful than any language model. It has the edge over other models in that it can perform tasks without extensive tuning; it only requires little textual-interactional demonstration, and the model does the rest. An advanced trained GPT model can make life easier by performing language translation, text summarization, question answering, chatbot integration, content generation, sentiment analysis, named entity recognition, text classification, text completion, text-to-speech synthesis and much more.\n\nThis article deeply delves into all aspects of GPT models and discusses the steps required to build a GPT model from scratch.\n\nWhat is a GPT model?\nWorking mechanism of GPT models\nPrerequisites to build a GPT model\nHow to create a GPT model? \u2013 Steps for building a GPT model\nThings to consider while building a GPT model\nWhat is a GPT model?\nGPT stands for Generative Pre-trained Transformer, the first generalized language model in NLP. Previously, language models were only designed for single tasks like text generation, summarization or classification. GPT is the first generalized language model ever created in the history of natural language processing that can be used for various NLP tasks. Now let us explore the three components of GPT, namely Generative, Pre-Trained, and Transformer and understand what they mean.\n\nGenerative: Generative models are statistical models used to generate new data. These models can learn the relationships between variables in a data set to generate new data points similar to those in the original data set.\nPre-trained: These models have been pre-trained using a large data set which can be used when it is difficult to train a new model. Although a pre-trained model might not be perfect, it can save time and improve performance.\nTransformer: The transformer model, an artificial neural network created in 2017, is the most well-known deep learning model capable of handling sequential data such as text. Many tasks like machine translation and text classification are performed using transformer models.\nGPT can perform various NLP tasks with high accuracy depending on the large datasets it was trained on and its architecture of billion parameters, allowing it to understand the logical connections within the data. GPT models, like the latest version GPT-3, have been pre-trained using text from five large datasets, including Common Crawl and WebText2. The corpus contains nearly a trillion words, allowing GPT-3 to perform NLP tasks quickly and without any examples of data.\n\nWorking mechanism of GPT models\nGPT is an AI language model based on transformer architecture that is pre-trained, generative, unsupervised, and capable of performing well in zero/one/few-shot multitask settings. It predicts the next token (an instance of a sequence of characters) from a sequence of tokens for NLP tasks, it has not been trained on. After seeing only a few examples, it can achieve the desired outcomes in certain benchmarks, including machine translation, Q&A and cloze tasks. GPT models calculate the likelihood of a word appearing in a text given that it appears in another text primarily based on conditional probability. For example, in the sentence, \u201cMargaret is organizing a garage sale\u2026Perhaps we could purchase that old\u2026\u201d the word chair is more likely appropriate than the word \u2018elephant\u2019. Also, transformer models use multiple units called attention blocks that learn which parts of a text sequence to be focused on. One transformer might have multiple attention blocks, each learning different aspects of a language.\n\n\nA transformer architecture has two main segments: an encoder that primarily operates on the input sequence and a decoder that operates on the target sequence during training and predicts the next item. For example, a transformer might take a sequence of English words and predict the French word in the correct translation until it is complete.\n\nThe encoder determines which parts of the input should be emphasized. For example, the encoder can read a sentence like \u201cThe quick brown fox jumped.\u201d It then calculates the embedding matrix (embedding in NLP allows words with similar meanings to have a similar representation) and converts it into a series of attention", "doc_id": "ce3614ba-5f70-411c-9453-f881f3ada68a", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "9ef7cdd4905776cc4343084e48a61bac23baa7ccacd2e7ce0727cd37d5db0b10", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 517514, "end": 533570}, "relationships": {"1": "d9152908-bd15-4715-85df-a4e7536a87b3", "2": "8c641895-851a-49d1-9a3e-65f682dace01", "3": "c4ca8006-1a92-467e-ad86-45285acb85c0"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c4ca8006-1a92-467e-ad86-45285acb85c0": {"text": "Also, transformer models use multiple units called attention blocks that learn which parts of a text sequence to be focused on. One transformer might have multiple attention blocks, each learning different aspects of a language.\n\n\nA transformer architecture has two main segments: an encoder that primarily operates on the input sequence and a decoder that operates on the target sequence during training and predicts the next item. For example, a transformer might take a sequence of English words and predict the French word in the correct translation until it is complete.\n\nThe encoder determines which parts of the input should be emphasized. For example, the encoder can read a sentence like \u201cThe quick brown fox jumped.\u201d It then calculates the embedding matrix (embedding in NLP allows words with similar meanings to have a similar representation) and converts it into a series of attention vectors. Now, what is an attention vector? You can view an attention vector in a transformer model as a special calculator, which helps the model understand which parts of any given information are most important in making a decision. Suppose you have been asked multiple questions in an exam that you must answer using different information pieces. The attention vector helps you to pick the most important information to answer each question. It works in the same way in the case of a transformer model.\n\nThe multi-head attention block initially produces these attention vectors. They are then normalized and passed into a fully connected layer. Normalization is again done before being passed to the decoder. During training, the encoder works directly on the target output sequence. Let us say that the target output is the French translation of the English sentence \u201cThe quick brown fox jumped.\u201d The decoder computes separate embedding vectors for each French word of the sentence. Additionally, the positional encoder is applied in the form of sine and cosine functions. Also, masked attention is used, which means that the first word of the French sentence is used, whereas all other words are masked. This allows the transformer to learn to predict the next French words. These outputs are then added and normalized before being passed on to another attention block which also receives the attention vectors generated by the encoder.\n\nAlongside, GPT models employ some data compression while consuming millions upon millions of sample texts to convert words into vectors which are nothing but numerical representations. The language model then unpacks the compressed text into human-friendly sentences. The model\u2019s accuracy is improved by compressing and decompressing text. This also allows it to calculate the conditional probability of each word. GPT models can perform well in \u201cfew shots\u201d settings and respond to text samples that have been seen before. They only require a few examples to produce pertinent responses because they have been trained on many text samples.\n\nBesides, GPT models have many capabilities, such as generating unprecedented-quality synthetic text samples. If you prime the model with an input, it will generate a long continuation. GPT models outperform other language models trained on domains such as Wikipedia, news, and books without using domain-specific training data. GPT learns language tasks such as reading comprehension, summarization and question answering from the text alone, without task-specific training data. These tasks\u2019 scores (\u201cscore\u201d refers to a numerical value the model assigns to represent the likelihood or probability of a given output or result) are not the best, but they suggest unsupervised techniques with sufficient data and computation that could benefit the tasks.\n\nHere is a comprehensive comparison of GPT models with other language models.\n\nCreate robust Stable Diffusion-powered apps with our AI development services\nLaunch your project with LeewayHertz\n\nLearn More\n \nFeature\nGPT\nBERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers)\nELMo (Embeddings from Language Models)\nPretraining approach\tUnidirectional language modeling\tBidirectional language modeling (masked language modeling and next sentence prediction)\tUnidirectional language modeling\nPretraining data\tLarge amounts of text from the internet\tLarge amounts of text from the internet\tA combination of internal and external corpus\nArchitecture\tTransformer network\tTransformer network\tDeep bi-directional LSTM network\nOutputs\tContext-aware token-level embeddings\tContext-aware token-level and sentence-level embeddings\tContext-aware word-level embeddings\nFine-tuning approach\tMulti-task fine-tuning (e.g., text classification, sequence labeling)\tMulti-task fine-tuning (e.g., text classification, question answering)\tFine-tuning on individual tasks\nAdvantages\tCan generate text, high flexibility in fine-tuning, large model size\tStrong performance on a variety of NLP tasks, considering the context in both directions\tGenerates task-specific features, considers context from the entire input sequence\nLimitations\tCan generate biased or inaccurate text, requires large amounts of data\tLimited to fine-tuning and requires task-specific architecture modifications; requires large amounts of data\tLimited context and task-specific; requires task-specific architecture modifications\nPrerequisites to build a GPT model\nTo build a GPT (Generative Pretrained Transformer) model, the following tools and resources are required:\n\nA deep learning framework, such as TensorFlow or PyTorch, to implement the model and train it on large amounts of data.\nA large amount of training data, such as text from books, articles, or websites to train the model on language patterns and structure.\nA high-performance computing environment, such as GPUs or TPUs, for accelerating the training process.\nKnowledge of deep learning concepts, such as neural networks and natural language processing (NLP), to design and implement the model.\nTools for data pre-processing and cleaning, such as Numpy, Pandas, or NLTK, to prepare the training data for input into the model.\nTools for evaluating the model, such as perplexity or BLEU scores, to measure its performance and make improvements.\nAn NLP library, such as spaCy or NLTK, for tokenizing, stemming and performing other NLP tasks on the input data.\nBesides, you need to understand the following deep learning concepts to build a GPT model:\n\nNeural networks: As GPT models implement neural networks, you must thoroughly understand how they work and their implementation techniques in a deep learning framework.\nNatural language Processing (NLP): For GPT modeling processes, tokenization, stemming, and text generation, NLP techniques are widely used. So, it is necessary to have a fundamental understanding of NLP techniques and their applications.\nTransformers: GPT models work based on transformer architecture, so understanding it and its role in language processing and generation is important.\nAttention mechanisms: Knowledge of how attention mechanisms work is essential to enhance the performance of the GPT model.\nPretraining: It is essential to apply the concept of pretraining to the GPT model to improve its performance on NLP tasks.\nGenerative models: Understanding the basic concepts and methods of generative models is essential to understand how they can be applied to build your own GPT model.\nLanguage modeling: GPT models work based on large amounts of text data. So, a clear understanding of language modeling is required to apply it for GPT model training.\nOptimization: An understanding of optimization algorithms, such as stochastic gradient descent, is required to optimize the GPT model during training.\nAlongside this, you need proficiency in any of the following programming languages with a solid understanding of programming concepts, such as object-oriented programming, data structures, and algorithms, to build a GPT model.\n\nPython: The most commonly used programming language in deep learning and AI. It has several libraries, such as TensorFlow, PyTorch, and Numpy, used for building and training GPT models.\nR: A popular programming language for data analysis and statistical modeling, with several packages for deep learning and AI.\nJulia: A high-level, high-performance programming language well-suited for numerical and scientific computing, including deep learning.\nHow to create a GPT model? A step-by-step guide\nBuilding a GPT model involves the following steps:\n\nStep 1: Data preparation\nTo prepare a dataset to build a GPT model, the following steps can be followed:\n\nData collection: You need to collect a large amount of text data, such as books, articles, and websites, to use it as the training data for your GPT model.\nData cleaning: You should remove any irrelevant information, such as HTML tags or irrelevant headers, and standardize the text format.\nTokenize the data: Divide the text into smaller units, such as words or subwords, to enable the model to learn the language patterns and structure.\nData pre-processing: Perform any necessary pre-processing tasks on the data, such as stemming, removing stop words, or converting the text to lowercase.\nSplit the data: Divide the cleaned and pre-processed data into different sets, such as training, validation, and test sets to evaluate the model\u2019s performance during training.\nBatch creation: Create batches of the training data to feed into the model during training. Depending on the requirements of the model, this can be done randomly or sequentially.\nConvert the data to tensor: TensorFlow and PyTorch are some basic data structures used in deep learning frameworks. So, you need to convert the data into tensors.\nIt is essential to ensure that the data is of high quality, diverse, and in sufficient quantity to train the GPT model effectively and avoid overfitting.\n\nStep 2: Model architecture selection\nModel architecture selection is a crucial step in building a GPT model. It primarily depends on the type of data and task being addressed. While choosing an architecture, you need to consider the following factors:\n\nTask complexity: The task complexity should be analyzed properly to identify the factors that can impact the architecture, such as the size of the output space, the presence of multi-label or multi-class outputs, the presence of additional constraints, etc. For example, complex tasks may require more layers or sophisticated attention mechanisms.\nData characteristics: You need to identify the characteristics of the data being processed, which include the length of the sequences, the presence of structured or unstructured data, and the size of the vocabulary. For example, longer sequences may require deeper networks, while convolutional neural networks benefit the structured data.\nComputational constraints: The choice of architecture also depends on the memory requirement of the computational resources available along with GPU resources. For example, larger models may require more memory and computational resources.\nUltimately, the choice of architecture is a trade-off between the desired performance, the computational resources available, and the complexity of the task and data. So, it needs careful experimentation and iteration to determine the best architecture for a given task.\n\nStep 3: Model training\nModel training is the most crucial phase of the entire GPT model-building process, as in this step, the model is exposed to vast amounts of text data and learns to predict the next word in a sequence based on the input context. During the training process, the model\u2019s parameters are adjusted in a way that its predictions become more accurate and it achieves a certain level of performance. The quality of the training data and the choice of hyperparameters greatly influence the performance of the final model, making model training a critical component in the development of GPT models.\n\nHere we will describe how to train a large GPT-2 model that can auto-complete your Python code. You can get the code from Github by searching with the string, codeparrot.\n\nHere are the basic steps followed in building the model:\n\nStep 1: Data generation\nBefore training the model, we need a large training dataset. For this Python code generation model, you can access the GitHub dump available on Google\u2019s BigQuery, which is filtered for all Python files and is a 180 GB dataset with 22 million files.\n\nThe SQL query to create the dataset is the following:\n\nCreate robust Stable Diffusion-powered apps with our AI development services\nLaunch your project with LeewayHertz\n\nLearn More\nSELECT\nf.repo_name, f.path, c.copies, c.size, c.content, l.license\nFROM\n`bigquery-public-data.github_repos.files` AS f\nJOIN\n`bigquery-public-data.github_repos.contents` AS c\nON\nf.id = c.id\nJOIN\n`bigquery-public-data.github_repos.licenses` AS l\nON\nf.repo_name = l.repo_name\nWHERE\nNOT c.binary\nAND ((f.path LIKE '%.py')\nAND (c.size BETWEEN 1024 AND 1048575))\nStep 2: Setting up the tokenizer and model\nTo train a GPT model, we need a tokenizer. Here we have used an existing tokenizer (e.g., GPT-2) and trained it on the dataset mentioned above with the train_new_from_iterator() method.\n\n# Iterator for Training\ndef batch_iterator(batch_size=10):\n    for _ in tqdm(range(0, args.n_examples, batch_size)):\n        yield [next(iter_dataset)[\"content\"] for _ in range(batch_size)]\n# Base tokenizer\ntokenizer = GPT2Tokenizer.from_pretrained(\"gpt2\")\nbase_vocab = list(bytes_to_unicode().values())\n# Load dataset\ndataset = load_dataset(\"lvwerra/codeparrot-clean\", split=\"train\", streaming=True)\niter_dataset = iter(dataset)\n# Training and saving\nnew_tokenizer = tokenizer.train_new_from_iterator(batch_iterator(),\n                                                  vocab_size=args.vocab_size,\n                                                  initial_alphabet=base_vocab)\nnew_tokenizer.save_pretrained(args.tokenizer_name, push_to_hub=args.push_to_hub)\nNext, a new model is initialized using the same hyperparameters as GPT-2 large (1.5B parameters). This model can be used to adjust the embedding layer to fit a new tokenizer, by adding some stability tweaks. The code snippet for the same is mentioned below:\n\ntokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(args.tokenizer_name)\n# Configuration\nconfig_kwargs = {\"vocab_size\": len(tokenizer),\n                 \"scale_attn_by_layer_idx\": True,\n                 \"reorder_and_upcast_attn\": True}\n# Load model with config and push to hub\nconfig = AutoConfig.from_pretrained('gpt2-large', **config_kwargs)\nmodel = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_config(config)\nmodel.save_pretrained(args.model_name, push_to_hub=args.push_to_hub)\nWith a streamlined tokenizer and a newly established model, we are ready to begin the model training process.\n\nStep 3: Implementing the training loop\nPrior to commencing the training, it\u2019s necessary to configure the optimizer and the schedule for the learning rate.

You\u2019ll notice that\naccelerator functions are utilized here, instead of PyTorch\u2019s native methods. Additionally, after every evaluation, the model is transferred to the accelerator.\n\n# Train model\nmodel.train()\ncompleted_steps = 0\nfor step, batch in enumerate(train_dataloader, start=1):\n    loss = model(batch, labels=batch, use_cache=False).loss\n    loss = loss / args.gradient_accumulation_steps\n    accelerator.backward(loss)\n    if step % args.gradient_accumulation_steps == 0:\n        accelerator.clip_grad_norm_(model.parameters(), 1.0)\n        optimizer.step()\n        lr_scheduler.step()\n        optimizer.zero_grad()\n        completed_steps += 1\n    if step % args.save_checkpoint_steps == 0:\n        eval_loss, perplexity = evaluate(args)\n        accelerator.wait_for_everyone()\n        unwrapped_model = accelerator.unwrap_model(model)\n        unwrapped_model.save_pretrained(args.save_dir, save_function=accelerator.save)\n        if accelerator.is_main_process:\n            hf_repo.push_to_hub(commit_message=f\"step {step}\")\n        model.train()\n    if completed_steps >= args.max_train_steps:\n        break\nDone! That\u2019s the code to train a full GPT-2 model. (However, you need to access the full code from the GitHub location as mentioned above)\n\nStep 4: Model evaluation\nModel evaluation is an important step you need to perform when building a GPT model, as it provides insight into how well the model is performing. The metrics used for evaluation vary depending on the task, but some common metrics include accuracy, perplexity, and F1 score.\n\nTo perform an evaluation in a GPT model, you must first set aside a portion of your training data for validation. During the training process, you can periodically evaluate the model on this validation set rather than the training set. You can then compare the model\u2019s performance on the validation set to its performance on the training set to check for overfitting.\n\nWhen evaluating the model, you can calculate various metrics based on the model\u2019s predictions and compare them to the actual outputs. For example, you can calculate the model\u2019s accuracy by comparing its predictions to the true labels, or you can calculate the perplexity of the model by evaluating how well it predicts the next word in a sequence.\n\nAfter evaluating the model, you can use the metrics to make informed decisions about how to improve the model, such as adjusting the learning rate, changing the model architecture, or increasing the amount of training data. Regular model evaluation and adjustment help refine the model and produce a high-performing GPT model.\n\nThings to consider while building a GPT model\nRemoving bias and toxicity\nAs we strive to build powerful generative AI models, we must be aware of the tremendous responsibility that comes with it. It is crucial to acknowledge that models such as GPT are trained on vast and unpredictable data from the internet, which can lead to biases and toxic language in the final product. As AI technology evolves, responsible practices become increasingly important. We must ensure that our AI models are developed and deployed ethically and with social responsibility in mind. Prioritizing responsible AI practices is vital in reducing the risks of biased and toxic content while fully unlocking the potential of generative AI to create a better world.\n\nIt is necessary to take a proactive approach to ensure that the output generated by AI models is free from bias and toxicity. This includes filtering training datasets to eliminate potentially harmful content and implementing watchdog models to monitor output in real-time. Furthermore, leveraging first-party data to train and fine-tune AI models can significantly enhance their quality. This allows customization to meet specific use cases, improving overall performance.\n\nImproving hallucination\nIt is essential to acknowledge that while GPT models can generate convincing arguments, they may not always be based on factual accuracy. Within the developer community, this issue is known as \u201challucination,\u201d which can reduce the reliability of the output produced by these AI models. To overcome this challenge, you need to consider the measures as taken by OpenAI and other vendors, including data augmentation, adversarial training, improved model architectures, and human evaluation to enhance the accuracy of the output and decrease the risk of hallucination and ensure output generated by the model is as precise and dependable as possible.\n\nPreventing data leakage\nEstablishing transparent policies is crucial to prevent developers from passing sensitive information into GPT models, which could be incorporated into the model and resurfaced in a public context. By implementing such policies, we can prevent the unintentional disclosure of sensitive information, safeguard the privacy and security of individuals and organizations, and avoid any negative consequences. This is essential to remain vigilant in safeguarding against potential risks associated with the use of GPT models and take proactive measures to mitigate them.\n\nIncorporating queries and actions\nCurrent generative models can provide answers based on their initial large training data set or smaller \u201cfine-tuning\u201d data sets, which are not real-time and historical. However, the next generation of models will take a significant leap forward. These models will possess the capability to identify when to seek information from external sources such as a database or Google or trigger actions in external systems, transforming generative models from isolated oracles to fully connected conversational interfaces with the world. By enabling this new level of connectivity, we can unlock a new set of use cases and possibilities for these models, creating a more dynamic and seamless user experience that provides real-time, relevant information and insights.\n\n\nEndnote\nGPT models are a significant milestone in the history of AI development, which is a part of a larger LLM trend that will grow in the future. Furthermore, OpenAI\u2019s groundbreaking move to provide API access is part of its model-as-a-service business scheme. Additionally, GPT\u2019s language-based capabilities allow for creating innovative products as it excels at tasks such as text summarization, classification, and interaction. GPT models are expected to shape the future internet and how we use technology and software. Building a GPT model may be challenging, but with the right approach and tools, it becomes a rewarding experience that opens up new opportunities for NLP applications.\n\nWant to get a competitive edge in your industry with cutting-edge GPT technology?

Prominent Generative AI models like Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), Variational AutoEncoders (VAEs), Generative Pretrained Transformer 3 (GPT-3), and other similar generative AI models have been gaining huge traction lately. Stable Diffusion is one such model with unique generative AI capabilities that has lately become a top choice for developers. This generative deep learning model learns the underlying data distribution of inputs through a controlled and steady diffusion process to produce high-quality and diverse outputs.\n\nThe Stable Diffusion model offers a powerful solution for various applications, including text generation, audio processing, and image categorization. By leveraging the capabilities of the Stable Diffusion model, developers can build apps with robust and user-friendly functionalities that can perform various tasks and make accurate predictions based on data inputs.\n\nThis article discusses the Stable Diffusion model and dives deep into its functioning. Other areas covered include app development with Stable Diffusion and Stable Diffusion model benefits. Finally, we will look at some of the best platforms to build apps using Stable Diffusion model.\n\nWhat is Stable Diffusion?\nHow does stable diffusion model work?\nStable Diffusion model benefits in app development\nHow to build an app using the Stable Diffusion model?\nStable Diffusion model in app development: Potential applications\nTop platforms and frameworks to develop a Stable diffusion model-powered app\nWhat is Stable Diffusion?\nStable Diffusion is an AI model launched publicly by Stability.ai in 2022. It is a text-to-image generative AI model designed to produce images matching input text prompts. Utilizing the latent diffusion model, a variant of the diffusion model, it effectively removes even the strongest noise from data. Leveraging various subsets of Machine Learning like deep learning, the model has extensively been trained by taking image-text pairs from the LAION-5B, a dataset that has over 5.85 billion image-text pairs.\n\nHow does Stable Diffusion model work?\nStable Diffusion utilizes a generative model known as the latent diffusion model to create new data similar to the data it was trained on. Gaussian noise is added to the training data to train the mode, and then the model recovers the original data by reversing the noise process. This method is repeated numerous times where the pixelated noise is added progressively with stronger noises added at each step, and", "doc_id": "c0498491-b6cd-450e-8d68-2503eeca66d5", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "da008c0d5186a77324db85ed2ddd8647308a0811f16ba38a67232e8731582292", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 548828, "end": 562981}, "relationships": {"1": "d9152908-bd15-4715-85df-a4e7536a87b3", "2": "c4ca8006-1a92-467e-ad86-45285acb85c0", "3": "684cc540-81cd-4487-ab5a-662a2d1f9d99"}, "__type__": "1"}, "684cc540-81cd-4487-ab5a-662a2d1f9d99": {"text": "input text prompts.

Leveraging various subsets of Machine Learning like deep learning, the model has extensively been trained by taking image-text pairs from the LAION-5B, a dataset that has over 5.85 billion image-text pairs.\n\nHow does Stable Diffusion model work?\nStable Diffusion utilizes a generative model known as the latent diffusion model to create new data similar to the data it was trained on. Gaussian noise is added to the training data to train the mode, and then the model recovers the original data by reversing the noise process. This method is repeated numerous times where the pixelated noise is added progressively with stronger noises added at each step, and the model is required to denoise the data. The process of adding noise to the image is known as forward diffusion, while the process of denoising or reversing the noise is known as reverse diffusion.\n\nStable Diffusion model work\nThe continuous training of the model leads to an upgraded denoiser model that has learned to clean data by mapping noisy data. This refined model can then produce new data by proceeding with a random noise through the denoiser. Although the new data may resemble the original data, it has variations controlled by the level of noise added.\n\nCompared to other generative models, Stable Diffusion is less prone to overfitting the training data. This is because the denoiser model must learn to denoise all noise levels due to the range of increasingly noisy data that it is trained on. As a result, the model generalizes well to new data and is less likely to overfit training data. This is why Stable Diffusion models are called \u201cstable.\u201d\n\nStable Diffusion model benefits for app development\nStable Diffusion model offers the following benefits to developers interested in building apps using it:\n\nNew data generation: With Stable Diffusion models, you can generate new data similar to the original training data, which proves useful in generating new pictures, text, or sounds.\nHigh-quality data: Compared to other generative models, the Stable Diffusion model is less prone to overfitting because it is trained on increasingly noisy versions of the training data. As such, it can produce high-quality results devoid of noise.\nEase of use: Stable Diffusion models are implemented using deep learning frameworks like TensorFlow or PyTorch. The high-level APIs these frameworks offer to build and train neural networks make Stable Diffusion models relatively simple to implement and experiment with.\nRobustness: A Stable Diffusion model is immune to changes in data distribution over time because it is not sensitive to variations in data distribution. As a result, it is well-suited for building applications that handle data variability.\nTransfer learning: To adapt Stable Diffusion models to a specific task, they can be fine-tuned on a smaller dataset. This is known as transfer learning, which can diminish the computation and data required to train a high-quality model for a particular use case.\nHere, we have discussed various Stable Diffusion model benefits for app development; let us now check out the steps involved in the process of app development with Stable Diffusion model.\n\nCreate robust Stable Diffusion-powered apps with our AI development services\nLaunch your project with LeewayHertz\n\nLearn More\nHow to build an app using the Stable Diffusion model?\nApp development with Stable Diffusion model is a complex process that utilizes numerous AI and Machine Learning tools and frameworks. Depending upon the app\u2019s complexity, the steps involved in building an app using the Stable Diffusion model may also vary. However, all app development process follows a general outline that includes the following steps:\n\nSetting up the development environment\nYou must first select the right programming language to set up the development environment. Based on the complexity of the application, you can go for programming languages like Python or R. Both these languages offer numerous libraries for machine learning and deep learning.\n\nNext, you need to install the required tools like code editor, machine learning and deep learning libraries, such as Tensorflow or PyTorch and any other necessary libraries, as per your use case and preference.\n\nYou must also prepare the development environment by generating a new project, configuring the required tools and setting up a version control system.\n\nWe will move forward with the programming language Python and the Machine learning library TensorFlow for this tutorial. So, download both.\n\nTo import the required libraries, run the following code:\n\nimport tensorflow as tf\nimport numpy as np\nNote that GPU is also required for this task. \n\nPreparing the data\nTraining the stable diffusion model requires understanding what type of data you will use, both input and output data. These data can be in the form of images, text, audio, or numerical values. You must also identify the data format like the resolution, size or number of dimensions. Once you find out the type and format of the data, you can start preparing the data to train the model.\nFirst, import all necessary modules and packages like \u2018random,\u2019 \u2018itertools,\u2019 and more. Run the following command:\n\nimport itertools\nimport json\nimport os\nimport random\nimport torch\nimport tempfile\nimport os, binascii\nNow, import the modules/libraries, functions/classes and most importantly, the dataset to train the model.\n\nfrom lib.augment import AugmentTransforms\nfrom pathlib import Path\nfrom PIL import Image\nfrom torch.utils.data import Dataset\nfrom torchvision import transforms\nfrom tqdm.auto import tqdm\nfrom lib.utils import get_local_rank\nDefine the class that loads and processes images from the \u2018dataset.\u2019 Then, establish an initialization method \u2018__init__\u2019 that takes numerous parameters to specify different aspects of images. The parameters can outline how the images should be processed, like the image size after resizing, the maximum length of the captions, whether to filter tags or allow duplicate images in the dataset and more.\n\ndef __init__(\nself,\nimg_path,\nsize=512,\ncenter_crop=False,\nmax_length=230,\nucg=0,\nrank=0,\naugment=None,\nprocess_tags=True,\ntokenizer=None,\nimportant_tags=[],\nallow_duplicates=False,\n**kwargs\n):\nYou can find the whole set of codes from this Github link. It is a library module that defines the dataset that, pre-processes the images and tokenizes prompts to train the module.\n\nTraining the model\nNow that we have pre-processed the data let us jump into training the stable diffusion model.\n\nInitialize and train the deep learning model.\n\nargs = parse_args()\nconfig = OmegaConf.load(args.config)\ndef main(args):\ntorch.manual_seed(config.trainer.seed)\nif args.model_path == None:\nargs.model_path = config.trainer.model_path\nstrategy = None\ntune = config.lightning.auto_scale_batch_size or config.lightning.auto_lr_find\nif config.lightning.accelerator in [\"gpu\", \"cpu\"] and not tune:\nstrategy = \"ddp_find_unused_parameters_false\"\nif config.arb.enabled:\nconfig.lightning.replace_sampler_ddp = False\nif config.trainer.use_hivemind:\nfrom lib.hivemind import init_hivemind\nstrategy = init_hivemind(config)\nif config.get(\"lora\"):\nfrom experiment.lora import LoRADiffusionModel\nmodel = LoRADiffusionModel(args.model_path, config, config.trainer.init_batch_size)\nstrategy = config.lightning.strategy = None\nelse:\nmodel = load_model(args.model_path, config)\nUsing the OmegaConf library, the above code snippet loads a configuration file for configuring model training options, including seed generation, model path, and hardware accelerator options. It also checks that the \u201clora\u201d option is present in the configuration file and sets various training options. A function called \u2018load_model\u2019 loads the model at the end of the code.\n\nNext, configure different callbacks for the PyTorch Lightning training loop.\n\nlogger = None\nif config.monitor.wandb_id != \"\":\nlogger = WandbLogger(project=config.monitor.wandb_id)\ncallbacks.append(LearningRateMonitor(logging_interval='step'))\nif config.get(\"custom_embeddings\") != None and config.custom_embeddings.enabled:\nfrom experiment.textual_inversion import CustomEmbeddingsCallback\ncallbacks.append(CustomEmbeddingsCallback(config.custom_embeddings))\nif not config.custom_embeddings.train_all and not config.custom_embeddings.concepts.trainable:\nif strategy == 'ddp':\nstrategy = 'ddp_find_unused_parameters_false'\nif config.custom_embeddings.freeze_unet:\nif strategy == 'ddp_find_unused_parameters_false':\nstrategy = 'ddp'\nif config.get(\"sampling\") != None and config.sampling.enabled:\ncallbacks.append(SampleCallback(config.sampling, logger))\nif config.lightning.get(\"strategy\") is None:\nconfig.lightning.strategy = strategy\nif not config.get(\"custom_embeddings\") or not config.custom_embeddings.freeze_unet:\ncallbacks.append(ModelCheckpoint(**config.checkpoint))\nenable_checkpointing = True\nelse:\nenable_checkpointing = False\nif config.lightning.get(\"enable_checkpointing\") == None:\nconfig.lightning.enable_checkpointing = enable_checkpointing\nFinally, use the callbacks and configurations to train the PyTorch Lightning model.\ntrainer = pl.Trainer(\nlogger=logger, \ncallbacks=callbacks,\n**config.lightning\n)\nif trainer.auto_scale_batch_size or trainer.auto_lr_find:\ntrainer.tune(model=model, scale_batch_size_kwargs={\"steps_per_trial\": 5})\ntrainer.fit(\nmodel=model,\nckpt_path=args.resume if args.resume else None\n)\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\nargs = parse_args()\nmain(args)\nYou can refer to the whole set of codes in this GitHub link.\n\nCreate robust Stable Diffusion-powered apps with our AI development services\nLaunch your project with LeewayHertz\n\nLearn More\nImplementing the Stable Diffusion model into your app\nThe previous steps involved identifying the data and processing it in the Stable Diffusion model to train them. Once the model is trained and evaluated for its performance, it can be integrated into the app. For Stable Diffusion model implementation into your app, first, design the app\u2019s user interface, like its buttons, layout and input fields. GUI toolkits such as Tkinter in Python or web frameworks such as Flask or Django are usually used for this step. The developed user interface is then linked to the trained Stable Diffusion model. You can achieve this by loading the trained model into TensorFlow and exposing it as a RESTful API via Flask or Django. Here is the code for loading the trained model into TensorFlow:\n\nimport tensorflow as tf\nmodel = tf.keras.models.load_model(\"path/to/trained/model\")\nNext, integrate the app\u2019s functionality, like generating new data or making predictions with the model. For this, you need to write the code that can use the model to process input data and return the output. The codes for this may vary based on the objective and functionality of the app. For instance, if the model is a classification model that makes predictions based on the input data, the codes might look like this:\n\ndef make_prediction(input_data):\npredictions = model.predict(input_data)\nreturn predictions\nOnce the model is integrated with the app, you need to test and debug the app. This step ensures that the app functions accurately without glitches; if any issues are found, they are debugged. It involves writing test cases and finding and fixing issues using a debugger tool like pdb in Python. Some commonly used testing tools and frameworks are Pytest, Unittest, Apache JMeter and Jenkins.\n\nDeploying the app\nThe final step in building a Stable Diffusion model-based application is deploying the app and continuously monitoring its performance. The steps involved in this process include the following:\n\nPackaging the app for deployment\nThis step requires you to create a package containing all the files and libraries you need to deploy the app. You can package the app as a standalone executable using tools like PyInstaller or cx_Freeze.\n\nAn example using PyInstaller is as follows:\n\n!pip install pyinstaller\n!pyinstaller --onefile --name=app app.py\nIt creates a standalone executable file named \u2018app\u2019 in the dist directory.\n\nSelecting a deployment platform\nThis step involves choosing a deployment platform for your app. Web servers like Apache or Nginx and cloud platforms like AWS or Google Cloud are popular options.\n\nDeploying the app\nIn this step, you must deploy your application to the chosen platform like Google Cloud. Note that the deployment procedure can vary depending on the platform you select.\n\nMonitoring the app\u2019s performance\nOnce the app is deployed, it needs to be monitored regularly to find out how it performs and its usage statistics. If any issues or bugs are discovered, they need to be fixed. AWS CloudWatch or Google Stackdriver are two tools you can utilize to keep track of the app\u2019s consumption and performance. Tools like AWS CloudWatch can fix any issues automatically by setting up the option of automated remediation actions.\n\nRemember that this is not an all-encompassing guide to app development with a stable diffusion model. The steps described may vary from app to app, depending on the use case, objective, target audience and specific features of the app. However, it covers all generic steps in building an app using a stable diffusion model.\n\nStable Diffusion model in app development: Potential applications\nThe greatest potential of the Stable Diffusion model that can be leveraged for app development is its ability to capture complex relationships and structured and unstructured data patterns. The potential applications of the Stable Diffusion model include the following:\n\nImage and video processing: Stable diffusion models can be applied to image and video processing tasks such as denoising, inpainting, and super-resolution. Clean and high-resolution images can be produced by training the model on noisy images.\nData generation and augmentation: The Stable Diffusion model can generate new data samples, similar to the training data, and thus, can be leveraged for data augmentation. In industries like healthcare, where collecting annotated data is challenging and costly, it can be handy for medical imaging.\nAnomaly detection: In the industries of finance or cybersecurity, Stable Diffusion models can be used to detect anomalies or unusual patterns in large datasets like network logs or security events, helping prevent fraud and promoting network security and quality control.\nData compression and dimensionality reduction: To reduce the size of large datasets, Stable Diffusion models can be used to compress a dataset into a lower-dimensional representation. This may prove useful in industries like finance and telecommunications, where storing large datasets is challenging.\nTime series analysis: It is possible to forecast future values and predict future trends using the Stable Diffusion model with time-series data, such as stock prices, weather patterns, and energy consumption.\nRecommender systems: Various domains, such as e-commerce, music and", "doc_id": "684cc540-81cd-4487-ab5a-662a2d1f9d99", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "30e4ba14629b9c2f619fad36e17f1c1cb9e986a782687c923ba84cd7fc76fa75", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 562836, "end": 577931}, "relationships": {"1": "d9152908-bd15-4715-85df-a4e7536a87b3", "2": "c0498491-b6cd-450e-8d68-2503eeca66d5", "3": "3f0e0c30-ae23-4f22-8f03-cab0572ec16b"}, "__type__": "1"}, "3f0e0c30-ae23-4f22-8f03-cab0572ec16b": {"text": "In the industries of finance or cybersecurity, Stable Diffusion models can be used to detect anomalies or unusual patterns in large datasets like network logs or security events, helping prevent fraud and promoting network security and quality control.\nData compression and dimensionality reduction: To reduce the size of large datasets, Stable Diffusion models can be used to compress a dataset into a lower-dimensional representation.

A user\u2019s past interactions with a product or service can be used to train the model to make personalized recommendations based on user behavior and preferences.\nTop platforms and frameworks to develop a Stable Diffusion model-powered app\nApp development with the Stable Diffusion model requires developers to choose from numerous robust platforms and frameworks designed for AI-based apps. There are many options available, but these are the most popular and widely used:\n\nTensorFlow\nAs a powerful and flexible open-source platform to build and deploy ML models, TensorFlow offers comprehensive and user-friendly frameworks for training the Stable Diffusion model. There are various types of neural networks supported by the platform, including convolutional neural networks (CNNs), recurrent neural networks (RNNs), and deep neural networks (DNNs). TensorFlow also provides numerous tools and libraries for preprocessing, transforming, and managing large datasets, essential for training AI models.\n\nKeras\nAn open-source software library called Keras offers ANNs a Python interface. It operates on top of Theano, CNTK, or TensorFlow. Keras was created to facilitate quick experimentation and can function on both CPU and GPU. As a high-level API, Keras makes it simple to create, train, and assess deep learning models.

Artificial intelligence has been a revolutionary technological breakthrough since 1955. This technology has seen rapid growth since the advent of the internet, which helped it to expand exponentially. Statistically speaking, the global conversational AI market is expected to grow from 4.8 billion in 2020 to USD 13.9 billion by 2025 at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 21.9%.\n\nAI has many sub-technologies and applications ranging from biometrics and computer vision to intelligent devices and self-driving cars. These AI technologies, coupled with abundant data, computing power, and cloud processing innovations, have catalyzed a sharp growth in AI adoption. Now, companies have access to an unprecedented amount of data, including dark data they didn\u2019t know they had. These treasure troves have proved to be a boon for the growth of AI.\n\nThough AI has long been considered a source of business innovation, it can add value only when done correctly. For this, we need to understand the core technologies working behind AI processes. However, AI is not one thing. It is a constellation of several technologies that enables machines to perceive, understand, act and learn with human-like intelligence. The AI landscape includes technologies like machine learning, natural language processing, and computer vision, which we will elaborately discuss in this article.\n\nWhat is artificial intelligence?\nKey components of AI applications\nData Collection\nData Storage\nData Processing and Analytics\nReporting and Data Output\nKey AI technologies used in AI development\nMachine Learning (ML)\nNatural Language Processing (NLP)\nComputer Vision\nDeep Learning\nGenerative Models\nExpert Systems\nThe layered approach of artificial intelligence technologies\nLayer 1: Data Layer\nLayer 2: The ML Framework and Packages Layer\nLayer 3: Model Layer\nLayer 4: Application Layer\nWhat is artificial intelligence?\nArtificial intelligence is broadly defined as a set of technologies that can perform tasks similar to human cognitive functions. As defined by John McCarthy, \u201cIt is the science and engineering of making intelligent machines, especially intelligent computer programs. It relates to the similar task of using computers to understand human intelligence, but AI does not have to confine itself to biologically observable methods.\u201d  AI allows computers to perform advanced functions such as understanding, translating, seeing and interpreting spoken and written languages, analyzing data, making recommendations and more. It unlocks the value of individuals and businesses by automating processes and providing insight into large data sets. Many AI applications, including robots, can navigate warehouses by themselves. Cybersecurity systems continuously analyze and improve themselves. Virtual assistants understand and respond to what people say.\n\nIn AI, it is a practice to develop theories, techniques, technologies, and application systems to simulate the expansion of human intelligence. Artificial intelligence research aims to allow machines to perform complex tasks that intelligent humans cannot. AI can perform not only repetitive tasks that can be automated but also the ones that require human intelligence.\n\nKey components of AI applications\nAI applications typically involve data, algorithms, and human feedback. Ensuring that each component is properly structured and validated to develop and implement AI applications is crucial. Here we will discuss how these components influence the AI development and implementation of AI applications.\n\nData\nData growth has been evident in almost all industries in the last decade due to the increasing use of mobile technology and digitization. Data has also become a key part of the services industry\u2019s business model. Service firms across industries can now collect data from internal and external sources, a key reason for AI exploration. Any AI application\u2019s success or training will depend on its data quality. AI applications are designed to analyze data and identify patterns to make predictions or decisions based on the discovered patterns. Applications continuously learn from errors made by these applications and improve their outputs as a result. This is usually done through human review and new information. AI applications generally yield the best results when the underlying data sets are large, valid, current and substantial.\n\nThere are different stages of data collection and refinement, as discussed below:\n\nData collection\nAI is dependent on the data that it gathers. AI works the same way as our brains which absorb huge amounts of information from the environment around us. This data can be sourced from many places in the AI technology stack. For example, the Internet of Things is a continuous rollout that allows millions of devices, from large-scale machinery to mobile phones, to be connected, allowing them to communicate with each other. An AI stack\u2019s data collection layer comprises the software that interfaces to these devices and a web-based service that supplies third-party data. These services range from marketing databases that contain contact information to news, weather, and social media application programming interfaces (APIs) that provide third-party data. Data collection can be done from human speech on which natural language processing can work to convert the speech into data regardless of background noise or commands being issued to a machine.\n\nData storage\nYou need to store the data once you have collected it or created streams that allow it to flow into your AI-enabled system in real-time. AI data can be structured or unstructured and could be big data that requires a lot of storage and must be accessible quickly. This is often where cloud technology plays a major role. Some organizations use Spark and Hadoop to give them the ability and resources to create their own distributed data centers that handle a large amount of information. Sometimes, however, third-party cloud infrastructure such as Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure is a better solution. Third-party cloud platforms allow organizations to scale storage as needed and save money. These platforms offer a variety of integration options with analytics services.\n\nData processing and analytics\nData processing is one of the key areas for artificial intelligence. Machine learning, deep learning, image recognition, etc., all take part in AI processing. The algorithms of these technologies can be accessed via a third-party API, deployed on a private or public cloud, within a private or public data center, data lake, or at the point of data collection. These algorithms are powerful, flexible and self-learning capable, making the current wave of AI different from the previous. The deployment of graphics processing units (GPUs) is responsible for increasing raw power. They are a great choice for data crunchers because of their mathematical prowess. In the near future, a new generation of processor units designed specifically for AI-related tasks will provide an additional quantum leap in AI performance.\n\nReporting and data output\nYour AI strategy should aim to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of machines (e.g., predictive maintenance or decreasing power or resource consumption). This technology will communicate the insights from your AI processing to the systems that can benefit. Other insights might be useful for humans. For example, sales assistants can use handheld terminals to access insights and make recommendations for customers. Sometimes the output can be in the form of charts, graphs and dashboards. This technology can also be used as a virtual personal assistant, such as Microsoft\u2019s Cortana and Apple\u2019s Siri. These products use natural language generation to convert digital information into human-friendly language. This, along with visuals, is the easiest form of data output that can be understood and acted upon.\n\nAlgorithms\nAn algorithm is a machine\u2019s organized set of steps to solve a problem or generate output from input data. Complex mathematical code is used in ML algorithms, allowing machines to learn from new input data and create new or modified outputs based on those learnings. A machine is not programmed to do a task but to learn to perform the task. Open-source AI algorithms have helped to fuel innovation in AI and make the technology more accessible to industries.\n\nHuman interaction\nAll stages of an AI", "doc_id": "3f0e0c30-ae23-4f22-8f03-cab0572ec16b", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "248d0a6c1ffa90b668ed2ea49853a16bb7ce1719a80334de8481728e0e693eca", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 577900, "end": 594007}, "relationships": {"1": "d9152908-bd15-4715-85df-a4e7536a87b3", "2": "684cc540-81cd-4487-ab5a-662a2d1f9d99", "3": "f6eee864-1f46-483f-829e-9ee69f2d9ebc"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f6eee864-1f46-483f-829e-9ee69f2d9ebc": {"text": "This technology can also be used as a virtual personal assistant, such as Microsoft\u2019s Cortana and Apple\u2019s Siri.

A machine is not programmed to do a task but to learn to perform the task. Open-source AI algorithms have helped to fuel innovation in AI and make the technology more accessible to industries.\n\nHuman interaction\nAll stages of an AI application\u2019s lifecycle require human involvement, including preparing data and algorithms, testing them, retaining models, and verifying their results. Human reviews are crucial to ensure that the data is appropriate for the application and the output is accurate, relevant, and useful as algorithms sort through the data. Technology and business stakeholders often work together to analyze AI-based outputs and provide feedback to the AI systems to improve the model. Lack of review can generate inadequate, inaccurate, or unsuitable results from AI systems, leading to inefficiencies, forgone opportunities, or new risks if action is taken based on faulty results.\n\nKey AI technologies used for AI development\nMachine Learning (ML)\nMachine learning is a subfield within artificial intelligence intending to mimic intelligent human behavior to perform complex tasks like human problem-solving. Data is the foundation of machine learning which includes photos, numbers, and text. Data is collected and stored to provide the training data for the machine learning model. The more data you have, the better the program is. Once the data is ready, programmers choose a machine-learning model to feed the data into it, and the model will train itself to predict patterns or make predictions. The programmer can tweak the model over time, changing its parameters and helping it to produce more accurate results. Some data is kept aside from the training data for evaluation, allowing the model to evaluate its accuracy when presented with new data. The model can be used with other data sets in the future.\n\nKey AI technologies used for AI development\nThere are three types of machine learning:\n\nSupervised machine learning models are trained using labeled data sets, allowing them to learn and become more precise over time. An algorithm could be trained with images of dogs and other objects, allowing it to recognize dogs by itself. Image classification and spam detection are some examples of supervised machine learning. This is the most popular type of machine learning model today.\n\nUnsupervised machine learning searches for patterns in unlabeled data and can find patterns and trends that users aren\u2019t explicitly seeking. An example of this is an unsupervised machine-learning program that could examine online sales data to identify different clients who make purchases. Clustering and anomaly detection are other examples of unsupervised machine learning applications.\n\nReinforcement machine learning trains machines through trial and error to take the most effective action by setting up a reward system. Reinforcement learning is used to train models to play games and to train autonomous vehicles to drive. It tells the machine when it has made the right decision, allowing it to learn which actions to take over time. Game playing and robotic control are some of the areas of reinforcement machine learning applications.\n\nMachine learning powers the recommendation engines that power Youtube and Netflix. It also determines what information you see on your Facebook page and for product recommendations. To detect fraudulent credit card transactions, log-in attempts or spam emails, machines can analyze patterns such as where someone spends their money or what they shop. Similarly, for chatbots and automatic helplines, customers and clients interact with machines instead of humans. These bots use machine learning and natural language processing to learn from past conversations to provide the right responses. Similarly, many technologies behind self-driving cars are based on machine learning, particularly deep learning. Machine learning programs can also be trained to analyze medical images and other information and look for signs of illness. For example, a program that can predict the risk of developing cancer-based on a mammogram.\n\nAutomate workflows and streamline business processes with robust AI-powered solutions\nLaunch your project with LeewayHertz\n\nLearn More\nNatural Language Processing (NLP)\nNatural Language Processing is a branch of computer science concerned with computers understanding text and spoken words like humans can. NLP combines computational linguistics-rule-based modeling of human language with statistical, machine learning, and deep learning modes. These technologies allow computers to process text and voice data from human beings and to understand their full meaning. NLP is a set of computer programs that can quickly translate text from one language into another, respond to spoken commands, and quickly summarize large amounts of text in real time. You are likely to have interacted with NLP through voice-operated GPS systems and digital assistants. NLP is also a key component of enterprise solutions, which help to streamline business operations, improve employee productivity, and simplify mission-critical business processes.\n\nNLP tasks help computers understand what they are ingesting by breaking down text and voice data. These are just a few of the tasks:\n\nSpeech recognition, also known as speech-to-text, is used to reliably convert voice data into text. Any application that uses voice commands to answer or follow spoken questions depends on speech recognition. It is difficult because people speak fast, often slurring words together and with different accents and emphases.\nPart of speech tagging is a process that determines the part of speech for a word or piece of text based on its context and use. For example, part of speech is used to identify \u2018make\u2019 in the following sentences as a verb in \u2018I can make a house\u2019 and as a noun in \u2018What make of car do you own?\u2019\nWord sense disambiguation refers to the process of semantic analysis in which the word that makes sense in the context is determined. Word sense disambiguation, for example, helps to distinguish between the meanings of the verb \u201cmake\u201d in \u201cmake the grade\u201d and \u201cmake a place\u201d.\nNamed entity recognition, or NEM identifies words and phrases as useful entities. NEM recognizes \u201cKentucky\u201d as a place or \u201cFred\u201d as a man\u2019s name.\nCo-reference resolution is the task of identifying if and when two words refer to the exact same entity. This commonly involves identifying the person or object to whom a particular pronoun refers (e.g., \u2018she\u2019 = \u2018Mary\u2019). However, it can also include identifying a metaphor or an idiom within the text.\nSentiment analysis attempts to extract subjective qualities like attitudes, emotions, sarcasm, confusion, and suspicion from the text.\nNatural language generation is sometimes referred to as speech recognition or speech-to-text. It is the process of converting structured information into human-readable language.\nThe new addition to natural language processing is transformer models. Some examples of transformer models used in NLP include:\n\nBERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers), developed by Google, is a pre-trained model that can be fine-tuned for various natural language understanding tasks such as named entity recognition, sentiment analysis, and question answering.\nGPT-2 (Generative Pre-trained Transformer 2), developed by OpenAI, is a pre-trained model that can be fine-tuned for various natural language generation tasks such as language translation, text summarization, and text completion.\nT5 (Text-to-Text Transfer Transformer), developed by Google, is a pre-trained model that can be fine-tuned for various natural language understanding and generation tasks using a simple text-based task specification.\nRoBERTa (Robustly Optimized BERT), developed by Facebook AI, is an optimized version of the BERT model that uses dynamic masking, larger batch sizes and longer training time to achieve better performance on various NLP tasks.\nALBERT (A Lite BERT), developed by Google, is a version of BERT designed to be smaller and faster while maintaining comparable performance on natural language understanding tasks.\nIn many real-world use cases, NLP is the driving force behind machine intelligence. Some of its applications are spam detection, machine translation like Google translate, chatbots and virtual agents, social media sentimental analysis, and text summarization.\n\nComputer vision\nComputer Vision is an area of artificial intelligence that allows computers and systems to extract meaningful information from digital images, videos and other visual inputs. Based on this information, they can take action or make recommendations. In simple terms, computer vision is the ability to see, understand, and observe with AI. Computer vision trains machines to perform these functions, which requires less time and more data, algorithms, cameras and data than it does with retinas, optic nerves, and visual cortex. You can detect subtle defects or issues in thousands of products and processes per minute using computer vision.\n\nThis is possible using two technologies: a type of machine learning called deep learning and a convolutional neuro network (CNN). These layered neural networks allow a computer to learn from visual data. The computer can learn how to distinguish one image from another if there is enough data. The computer uses a CNN to \u201clook at\u201d the image data as it feeds through the model. CNN is used to help a machine learning/deep learning model understand images by breaking them into pixels. These pixels are then given labels that allow for training specific features (image annotation). The AI model uses labels to make predictions and convolutions about what it \u201csees.\u201d It then checks the accuracy of its predictions iteratively until they meet expectations.\n\nThere are two types of algorithm families in computer vision, specifically for object detection. The single-stage algorithm aims for the fastest processing speed and highest computational efficiency. RetinaNet and SSD are the most popular algorithms. On the other hand, multi-stage algorithms are multi-step and provide the best accuracy, but they can be quite heavy and resource intensive. Recurrent Convolutional Networks (RCN) are the most popular multi-stage algorithms, including Fast RCNN and Mask-RCNN.\n\nHere are some computer vision techniques:\n\nImage classification\nImage classification is the simplest computer vision method, mainly categorizing an image into one or several different categories. Image classifier takes the image and gives information about the objects in it. It would not provide any additional information, such as the number of persons present, tree color, item positions and so on. There are two main types of image classification: binary and multi-class classification. As the name implies, binary image classification looks for one class in an image and returns results based on whether or not it has that object. We can train an AI system to detect skin cancer in humans and achieve amazing results by using images with skin cancer and images without skin cancer.\n\nObject detection\nAnother popular computer vision technique is object detection which can be used after image classification or uses image classification to detect objects in visual data. It\u2019s used to identify objects within the boundaries boxes and determine the object class in an image. Object detection uses deep learning and machine learning technologies to produce useful results. Humans can recognize objects in visuals and videos within seconds. Object detection aims to reproduce human intelligence to locate and identify objects. There are many applications for object detection, such as object tracking, retrieval and image captioning. Many methods can be used for object detection, including R-CNN and YOLO v2.\n\nSemantic segmentation\n\nSemantic segmentation does more than detect the classes in an image and includes image classification. It classifies every pixel in an image to identify what objects they have. It attempts to identify the role of each individual pixel within the image and classifies pixels in a specific category without distinguishing the object instances. It can also be said that it classes similar objects from all pixel levels as one class. Semantic segmentation will place an image with two dogs under the same label. It attempts to determine the role of each pixel within an image.\n\nInstance segmentation\nInstance segmentation can classify objects at the pixel level, similar to semantic segmentation but with a higher level. Instance segmentation can classify objects of similar types into different categories. If the visual comprises many cars, semantic segmentation can identify them all. However, instance segmentation can be used to label them according to color, shape, etc. Instance segmentation, a common computer vision task, is more difficult than other techniques because it requires visual data analysis with different backgrounds and overlapping objects. CNN and Convolutional Neural networks can be used to segment instances. They can find the objects at the pixel level instead of just bounding them.\n\nPanoptic segmentation\nPanoptic segmentation combines instance and semantic segmentation and is one of the most powerful computer vision techniques. Pantopic segmentation can classify images at the pixel level and identify individual instances of the class.\n\nKeypoint detection\nKeypoint detecting is a technique that identifies key points within an image to provide more information about a particular class of objects. It detects people and locates their key points, mainly focusing on two key areas: body keypoint detection and facial keypoint detection.\n\nFor example, facial keypoint detection detects key features of the face like the nose, eyes and corners. Face detection, pose detection, and others are some of the main applications for keypoint detection. Pose estimation allows us to determine what pose someone uses in an image. This usually includes their head, eyes, and nose location and where their arms, shoulders, legs, hands, neck, chest, and knees are. It can be done one-to-one or for multiple people depending on the need.\n\nPerson segmentation\nPerson segmentation is an image segmentation technique that distinguishes a person from the background. This can be done after the pose estimation. With this, we can identify the exact location and pose of the person within the image.\n\nDepth perception\nDepth perception is a computer vision technique that provides visual abilities to computers to determine the depth and distance of objects from their source. It can be used for many purposes, such as reconstructing objects in augmented reality, robotics, and self-driving cars. LiDAR (Light detection and ranging) is one of the most popular techniques for in-depth perceptual. Laser beams are used to measure the distance between objects by shining laser light on them and measuring their reflection with sensors.\n\nImage captioning\nAs its name implies, image captioning is about adding a caption to an image that describes it, and it uses neural networks. When we feed an image as the input, it generates a caption that describes the image, which is not a task for computer vision but also an NLP task.\n\n3D object reconstruction\n3D object reconstruction, as the name implies, is a technique for extracting 3D objects from 2D images. It is a rapidly developing area of computer vision and can be done differently depending on the object. PiFuHD is one of the most popular papers on this technique which discusses 3D human digitization.\n\nCompanies are rapidly adopting computer vision technology across all industries to solve automation issues with computers that can see. Visual AI technology is rapidly improving, enabling new computer vision projects and ideas to be implemented. For example, PPE detection, object counting, automated product inspection and process automation are some of the applications of industrial computer vision techniques in manufacturing. Similarly, automated human fall detection is a widely used application of computer vision in healthcare.

Similarly, automated human fall detection is a widely used application of computer vision in healthcare. Computer vision is also applied in agriculture, security, smart cities, retail, insurance, logistics and pharmaceutical.\n\nDeep learning\nDeep learning is a machine learning technique that teaches computers how to naturally do things humans can. It teaches computers to process data like the human brain\u2019s thought process. Deep learning models can recognize complex text, image, and sound patterns and produce precise insights and predictions. Using deep learning, we can automate tasks that normally require human intelligence. The components of deep learning are as follows:\n\nDeep Learning Technique\nInput layer\nA neural network has many nodes that input data into it. These nodes form the input layer of an artificial neural network.\nHidden layer\nThe input layer processes the data and passes it on to the layers in the neural network. These hidden layers process information at different levels and adapt their behavior as they receive new information. Deep learning networks can analyze a problem from many angles using hundreds of hidden layers. \u201cDeep\u201d is often used to refer to the number of hidden layers of a neural network.\nAutomate workflows and streamline business processes with robust AI-powered solutions\nLaunch your project with LeewayHertz\n\nLearn More\nIf you were to be given an image of an unknown creature that you needed to classify, then you would compare it with animals that you are familiar with. You would examine the animal\u2019s shape, ears and size, fur pattern, and the number of legs. You might try to spot the patterns with cows, deer or other animals with hooves. Deep neural networks\u2019 hidden layers work in the exact same way. Deep learning algorithms use these hidden layers to categorize an animal image. Each layer processes a different aspect of the animal to help them classify it.\n\nOutput layer\nThese nodes produce the data that make up the output layer. Two nodes are required for deep learning models that output \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno\u201d answers. However, models that produce a wider range of answers have more nodes. Deep learning uses neural network architectures, so many deep learning models are called high-performance neural networks. Deep networks can contain up to 150 layers.\nDeep learning models can be trained using large amounts of labeled data. Using neural network architectures, it learns features from the data without requiring feature extraction.\n\nSome of the widely used deep learning algorithms are as follows:\n\nLong Short Term Memory Networks (LSTMs)\nRecurrent neural network (RNN)\nConvolution neural network (CNN)\nRestricted Boltzmann machine(RBM)\nAutoencoders\nGeneral Adversarial Networks (GANs)\nRadial Basis Function Networks (RBFNs)\nMultilayer Perceptrons (MLPs)\nDeep Belief Networks (DBNs)\nSelf-driving cars, voice-controlled assistance, automatic image caption generation and automatic machine translation are some deep learning applications.\nGenerative models\nGenerative AI includes unsupervised or semi-supervised machine learning algorithms that allow computers to use existing text, audio, and video files and even code to create new content. The goal is to create original items that look exactly like the real thing. Generative AI is a method that allows computers to abstract the underlying patterns of input data to enable them to generate new output content.\n\nGenerative modeling\nInstead of predicting which features will be given a particular label, generative algorithms attempt to predict what features will be given to that label. While discriminative algorithms focus on the relationships between x, and y, generative models are concerned with how to get x. Mathematically, we can use generative modeling to calculate the likelihood of x or y occurring together. It does not learn the boundary but the distribution of individual features and classes. Generative models learn features and their relations to understand an object. These algorithms can recreate images of objects even if they are not part of the training set. A generative algorithm is a method that models a process holistically without discarding any data. GANs and other transformer model algorithms are examples of such innovative technologies.\n\nLet\u2019s discuss two of the most popular generative AI models.\n\nGenerative Adversarial networks or GANs are technologies that create multimedia artifacts using both textual and imagery input data. It is a machine learning algorithm that pits two neural networks \u2013 a generator and a discriminator against one other. This is why it is called adversarial. The contest between two neural networks forms a zero-sum game where one agent wins, and another loses. GANs are composed of two models:\nGenerator \u2013 A neural network that creates fake input or fake samples from a random vector (a list containing mathematical variables whose values are unknown).\n\nDiscriminator \u2013 This neural network can identify fake samples from a generator and real samples from the domain. The binary discriminator returns probabilities of a number between 1 and 0. The more likely the output is fake, the closer it is to 0. The reverse is true: numbers closer to 1 indicate a greater likelihood that the prediction will be accurate.\n\nBoth the generator and discriminator can be used as CNNs, particularly when working with images.\n\nTransformer-based models \u2013 Technologies such as Generative Pretrained (GPT) language models use internet information to create textual content, from press releases to whitepapers to website articles. GPT3 and LaMDA are two of the most popular examples of transformer-based models.\nA transformer converts one sequence into another. In this model, semi-supervised learning is trained using large, unlabeled data sets and then fine-tuned with supervised training to improve performance. The encoder processes the input sequence, which extracts all the features from a sequence and converts them into vectors. (e.g., vectors that represent the semantics and position of a word in the sentence). It then passes them on to the decoder. The decoder is responsible for the output sequence. Each decoder takes the encoder layer outputs and derives context to create the output sequence. Transformers use sequence-to-sequence learning, meaning that the transformer uses a sequence of tokens to predict the next word in an output sequence. Iterating encoder layers do this.\n\nSome generative model applications include image generation, image-to-text generation, text-to-image translation, text-to-speech, audio generation, video generation, image and video resolution enhancement, and synthetic data generation.\n\nExpert systems\nAn expert system is an interactive, reliable, computer-based AI decision-making system that uses facts and heuristics to solve complex decision-making issues. The highest-level human intelligence and expertise solve the most difficult problems in a particular domain.\n\nAn expert system\u2019s Knowledgebase is what gives it strength. This is a collection of facts and heuristics organized about the system\u2019s domain. An expert system is constructed in a process called Knowledge Engineering, during which knowledge about the domain is gathered from human experts and other sources. Expert systems are marked by the accumulation of knowledge in knowledge banks, which can be used to draw conclusions from the inference engine. An expert system\u2019s knowledge base contains both factual knowledge and heuristic information. Knowledge representation is how knowledge is organized in the knowledge base. These knowledge bases represent notions such as actions that can be taken according to circumstances, causality and time.\n\nThe inference engine combines the facts of a particular case with the knowledge in the knowledge base to produce a recommendation. The inference engine controls the order to apply production rules in a rule-based expert system. The case facts are recorded in the working memories, which act as a blackboard and accumulate the relevant knowledge. Inference engines repeatedly apply the rules to the working memories, adding new information until the goal state is reached or confirmed.\n\nAn expert system works mainly on two mechanisms as described below:\n\nForward chaining is a data-driven strategy. The inferencing process leads to a conclusion from the facts of the case. This strategy is based on the facts in the case and the business cases that can satisfy them. Inference engines attempt to match the conditions (IF), part of each rule, in a knowledge base with facts currently in the working memory. When multiple rules match, a conflict resolution procedure will be invoked. For example, the rule with the lowest number that adds new information is fired. The firing rule\u2019s conclusion is added to the working memories. Forward-chaining systems can solve open-ended design and planning problems, such as establishing the configuration for a complex product.\n\nBackward chaining is the process where the inference engine attempts to match the hypothesis with the conclusion (THEN). If such a rule can be found, the premise of the rule becomes the new subgoal. This strategy is good for an expert system with few possible goal states. In this process, the system will try to provide another goal state if the premises do not support a hypothesized goal. So, all possible conclusions are reviewed until a goal state can be supported in the premises.\nBackward chaining works best for applications where the possible conclusions are small and clearly defined. These systems are often used for diagnosing or classifying patients. Each possible conclusion can then be verified against the data to confirm validity.\n\nLoan analysis, stock market trading, virus detection, warehouse optimization, and airline scheduling are some of the applications of expert systems.\n\nThe layered approach of artificial intelligence technologies\nWe have so far described the key AI technologies; now, let\u2019s have an overview of where they are placed in the layered architecture of the AI ecosystem.\n\nThe Layered Approach of Artificial Intelligence Technologies\nWe can describe an AI ecosystem as having the following four layers.\nData layer\nML frameworks and packages or Algorithm layer\nModel layer\nApplication layer\nAutomate workflows and streamline business processes with robust AI-powered solutions\nLaunch your project with LeewayHertz\n\nLearn More\nLayer 1: Data layer\nArtificial intelligence comprises many technologies, such as machine learning, natural language processing, image recognition, etc., discussed in the previous section. Data plays the most critical role in the functioning of all these technologies, which is also the foundation layer of AI technologies. This layer plays a key role in data preparation.\n\nSub-layer \u2013 The hardware platform\nIn the layered approach of core AI technologies, the hardware platform and low-level primitives can be considered a sub-layer of the data layer, as they provide the necessary infrastructure for training and running AI models. They allow developers to optimize AI models\u2019 performance and use the most appropriate hardware for a specific task.\n\nWhen it comes to large data crunching, powerful machines are key aspects. Iterative algorithms require continuous learning and simulations, which requires an elastic and reliable IT infrastructure. Additionally, the current state-of-the-art techniques, such as deep learning algorithms, require large computational resources.\n\nGPU is an important addition to this requirement. Backend operations such as matrix calculations and parallel calculations of relatively easy equations are extremely useful for calculating ML algorithms. The GPUs can even be used to train neural networks-simulations for the human brain that form the basis of modern ML.The hardware design of these GPUs were originally intended for graphics computations and not AI. However, things are changing fast.\n\nThese machines, particularly the IaaS model, have given the computing and memory resources needed to crunch large amounts of data, greatly reducing the time required to train ML algorithms. What used to take several weeks to run in a traditional data center now takes only a few hours in the cloud.\n\nLow-level software libraries, such as Intel Math Kernel Library and Nvidia CuDNN, that directly work with GPUs are another side of the equation. These have dramatically increased GPU ML processing speeds. The speed advantage is also available when the same code is integrated into a CPU, as in Intel MKL. CuDNN and MKL libraries can be created and integrated into frameworks to increase hardware utilization and information extraction without the need for software engineers.\n\nLayer 2: The ML framework and packages or algorithm layer\nThe availability of large amounts of data, as well as the accessibility to robust infrastructures like AWS, is changing the landscape of ML. Machine learning engineers who work with data scientists to understand a particular field\u2019s business and theoretical aspects create ML frameworks. Some of the popular ML frameworks are as follows:\n\nTensorFlow \u2013 An open-source software library for machine learning developed by Google Brain Team.\nPyTorch \u2013 An open-source machine learning library developed by Facebook\u2019s AI Research lab.\nScikit-Learn \u2013 A simple and efficient library for machine learning in Python.\nKeras \u2013 A high-level neural networks API written in Python and capable of running on top of TensorFlow, CNTK, or Theano.\nCaffe \u2013 A deep learning framework developed by Berkeley AI Research and community contributors.\nMicrosoft Cognitive Toolkit (CNTK) \u2013 A deep learning toolkit developed by Microsoft.\nLightGBM \u2013 A gradient-boosting framework that uses tree-based learning algorithms.\nXGBoost \u2013 A gradient-boosting library designed for speed and performance.\nSpark MLlib \u2013 A machine learning library for the Apache Spark platform.\nRandom Forest \u2013 A popular ensemble method for classification and regression, implemented in many libraries such as scikit-learn, R, and Weka.\nIn the layered approach of AI core technologies, ML frameworks and packages can be considered part of the algorithm layer, as they provide the necessary functionality to implement and train AI models and allow developers to use pre-built functions and classes to construct and train models easily.\n\nLayer 3: Model layer\nThe model layer of AI technology implements AI models, trained and fine-tuned using data and algorithms from the algorithm layer. This layer enables the actual decision-making capability of the AI system. Multiple components build this layer, as described below:\n\nModel structure\nIt is the most crucial component of the model layer and refers to the model\u2019s architecture. This layer of AI technology determines the capacity and expressiveness of the model. It includes the number of layers, the number of neurons per layer, and the type of activation functions used.\n\nModel structures can be classified into several categories, such as Feedforward Neural Networks, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), Autoencoder, and Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). The selection of a particular model depends on the available data, problem domain, and available resources.\n\nModel parameters\nIt refers to the values learned during the training process, such as the weights and biases of the neural network. These parameters make predictions and decisions based on the input data. In neural networks, the model parameters are the weights and biases of the neurons in each layer, where weights determine the strength of the connections between neurons, and the biases determine the activation threshold of each neuron.\n\nLoss function\nIt is a metric used to evaluate the", "doc_id": "f2b9ed8e-25e7-4944-b73d-e04d7be824ec", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "20fe940b5256d7d8775cf1d0a46f59dc99b3eb29d305a5bf1785f860ca967769", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 610752, "end": 627311}, "relationships": {"1": "d9152908-bd15-4715-85df-a4e7536a87b3", "2": "f6eee864-1f46-483f-829e-9ee69f2d9ebc", "3": "ccb839c0-ab0b-4026-a1ad-565d4120ba9c"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ccb839c0-ab0b-4026-a1ad-565d4120ba9c": {"text": "structures can be classified into several categories, such as Feedforward Neural Networks, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), Autoencoder, and Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs).

These parameters make predictions and decisions based on the input data. In neural networks, the model parameters are the weights and biases of the neurons in each layer, where weights determine the strength of the connections between neurons, and the biases determine the activation threshold of each neuron.\n\nLoss function\nIt is a metric used to evaluate the model\u2019s performance during training. It measures the difference between the predicted output and the true output and is used to guide the optimization process of the model. The goal of the training process is to minimize the loss of function.\n\nIt\u2019s worth mentioning that in some cases, it\u2019s possible to use different loss functions depending on the stage of the training, for example, using BCE in the early stages of the training and then to switch to the CEL in the later stages; this technique is called curriculum learning.\n\nOptimizer\nThe Optimizer in AI technology is an algorithm that adjusts model parameters to minimize the loss function. It is a crucial component of the model layer, responsible for updating model parameters during the training process.\n\nThere are several types of optimizers, each with its own strengths and weaknesses like Gradient Descent (GD), Adaptive Gradient Algorithm (AdaGrad), Adaptive Moment Estimation (Adam), Root Mean Square Propagation (RMSprop), Radial Base Function (RBF) and Limited-memory BFGS (L-BFGS). The choice of optimizer depends on the problem domain, the data available, and the resources available. For example, if it is sparse data and has many features, the AdaGrad optimizer is the better choice. Similarly, for the non-stationary data, Adam or RMSprop is more appropriate.\n\nIt\u2019s worth mentioning that we can select the optimizer based on the type of model, the size of data and the computational resources available, and in some cases, the combination of multiple optimizers with different parameters can be used to improve the performance.\n\nRegularization\nRegularization in AI technology is a technique that prevents overfitting, a common problem in machine learning. Overfitting occurs when a model is too complex and adapts too much to the training data, resulting in poor performance on new and unseen data. Regularization methods help to constrain the model and improve its generalization ability.\nSeveral types of regularization methods, each with its own strengths and weaknesses, like L1 Regularization (Lasso), L2 Regularization (Ridge), Elastic Net, Dropout, and Early Stopping.\n\nIt\u2019s worth mentioning that this layer can have different types of models, such as supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement models, each with different requirements. The design of the models in this layer should consider the problem domain and the data available.\n\nLayer 4: Application layer\nThis layer represents how AI systems are used to solve specific problems or perform certain tasks. This covers a broad range of applications, such as decision-making, natural language processing, and computer vision techniques. This layer solves real-world problems and provides tangible benefits for individuals and companies.\n\nRobotics, gaming, bioinformatics, and education are a few other applications of AI.\n\nEndnote\nThe world is poised to revolutionize many sectors with artificial intelligence and data analysis. Already, there are large deployments in finance and national security. These developments have significant economic and social benefits, and the key AI technologies have made them possible. These technologies have brought about unprecedented advancements in various industries using machine learning, natural language processing, computer vision and deep learning. They have also created new opportunities for businesses and individuals to automate processes, improve decision-making, and enhance customer experience.

The emergence of diverse AI applications and tools has enabled businesses to make wiser decisions and automate repetitive tasks, making operations more efficient and effective. Although many AI algorithms exist, generative AI has gained prominence across industries.\n\nWith the popularity of prominent generative AI tools like Midjourney and ChatGPT, businesses can generate new ideas, content, and solutions faster than ever before. This improves decision-making, streamlines operations, and allows businesses to stay competitive in an ever-evolving market by creating new products and services. Generative AI is proving to be a game-changer in the business world, with its potential being widely recognized in 2023.\n\nThrough this article, let us look at generative AI use cases and applications in various industry domains.\n\nWhat is Generative AI?\nGenerative AI models\nGenerative AI Use Cases\nPopular Generative AI applications across industries\nWhat is Generative AI?\nGenerative AI is a subfield of Artificial Intelligence that utilizes Machine Learning techniques like unsupervised learning algorithms to generate content like digital videos, images, audio, text or codes. In unsupervised learning, the model is trained on a dataset without labeled outputs. The model must discover patterns and structures independently without any human guidance. Generative AI aims to utilize generative AI models to inspect data and produce new and original content based on that data.\n\nGenerative AI tools use sophisticated algorithms to assess data and derive novel and unique insights, thereby improving decision-making and streamlining operations. The application of generative AI can also help businesses stay competitive in an ever-changing market by creating customized products and services.\n\nUsing Generative AI, computers can generate new content output by abstracting the underlying patterns from the input data.\n\nGenerative AI models\nGenerative AI commonly works by training a deep learning model on a dataset of pictures, which is then applied to create new images. It utilizes several Generative AI models like BERT and Transformer or Autoregressive models. However, Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) are two of the most prominent generative AI model types.\n\nA GAN comprises two components: a generator and a discriminator. While the generator is trained to produce new images that mimic those in the training set, the discriminator is trained to discriminate between actual photos from the training set and fake images generated by the generator. The generator and discriminator are trained in tandem in a procedure known as adversarial training. During this training, the generator tries to produce images that can dupe the discriminator while the discriminator strives to detect counterfeit images accurately. The generator gets better with time and can create more lifelike images.\n\n\nVAEs, on the other hand, work by learning probabilistic mapping from a high-dimensional input space like a photograph to a lower-dimensional unrevealed space and then back to the original space. While training, the VAE is exposed to a large dataset of pictures, and it learns the patterns and features of images to understand the probability distribution of the images. Once trained, the model can produce new images from the dataset by taking samples from the hidden space and mapping them back to the original space.\n\nIn the case of GAN or VAE, the model, once trained, can produce a new image or content that mimics the ones in the training set. This technology has multiple applications, including creating realistic computer-generated images, refining low-quality images, and drawing new images from text descriptions.\n\nNow that we know how Generative AI works let us look into the use cases of Generative AI.\n\nBe a part of the growing content economy with apps featuring powerful generative AI capabilities\nLaunch your project with LeewayHertz\n\nLearn More\nGenerative AI Use Cases\nUse cases of generative AI can be categorized into different types based on the content it produces: visuals, audio, text or codes. Let us explore Generative AI use cases pertaining to these domains separately.\n\nUse cases in visual content\n1. Image generation and enhancement\nGenerative AI tools for image generation are usually text-to-image. Users can enter the text describing what images they want, and the tool will process them to produce realistic images. Users can specify a subject, setting, style, object or location to the AI tool, which will generate amazing images pertaining to your requirement.\n\nIn addition to text-to-image AI tools, which create realistic 3D models or realistic original artwork, there are tools available for image enhancement that modify existing images. These are some of the functions it can perform:\n\nImage completion: AI tools with this capability can generate missing parts of an image, like creating a realistic background for an object, filling in missing pixels, or fixing a torn photograph.\nSemantic image-to-photo translation: It involves creating a photo-realistic version of an image based on a sketch or a semantic image.\nImage manipulation: It includes modifying or altering an existing image, like transforming the external elements of an image, such as its style, lighting, color or form, while maintaining its original elements.\nImage super-resolution: Tools possessing this capability can enhance the resolution of an image without losing its specific details. For instance, users can improve the quality of an image captured on CCTV.\nExamples of Image generation AI tools include Midjourney and DALL.E.\n\n2. Video creation\nGenerative AI simplifies the process of video production by offering more efficient and flexible tools for generating high-quality video content. It can automate tedious tasks like video composing, adding special effects, animation, etc. Similar to image generation, AI tools for video production can generate videos from the ground up and be used for video manipulation, enhancing video resolution and completion. They can also perform the following tasks:\n\nVideo prediction: It involves predicting future frames in a video, such as objects or characters moving in a scene, using generative models. It can understand a video\u2019s temporal and spatial elements, produce the following sequence based on that information and discern between probable and non-probable sequences.\nVideo style transfer: AI video generators with this capability can produce a new video that adheres to another video\u2019s style or a reference image.\n3. 3D shape generation\nGenerative AI tools can be used to create 3D shapes and models utilizing a generative model. This can be achieved through various techniques like VAEs, GANs, autoregressive models or neural implicit fields. AI tools for 3D shape generation are beneficial in creating detailed shapes that might not be possible when manually generating a 3D image. It can also be leveraged to boost the performance of 3D-based tasks like 3D printing, 3D scanning and virtual reality.\n\nGenerative AI use cases in an audio generation\n1. Creating music\nGenerative AIs are beneficial in producing new music pieces. Generative AI-based tools can generate new music by learning the patterns and styles of input music and creating fresh compositions for advertisements or other purposes in the creative field.

Speech-to-speech (STS) conversion\nIn audio-related AI applications, generative AI generates new voices using existing audio files. Utilizing STS conversion, professionals in the gaming and film industry can easily and swiftly create voiceovers.\n\nGenerative AI use cases\nText generation\nText generative AI platforms like ChatGPT have become increasingly popular since their launch. Such platforms are highly efficient in generating content like articles or blog posts, dialogues, summarizing text, translating languages, completing a piece of text or automatically generating a text for a website and more. Systems are trained on large data sets to create authentic and updated content.\n\nMost text-generation AI utilizes the Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Natural Language Understanding (NLU) techniques of AI to read a text prompt, understand the context and intend and produce intelligent responses to the users. Such tools are trained on large data sets to create authentic and updated content.\n\nOther than generating new content, text-generative AI tools can efficiently perform numerous other language-related tasks like answering questions, completing an incomplete text, classifying text into different categories, rephrasing and improving content and engaging in human-like discussions on multiple topics. Generative AI models for text generation can be leveraged for the following:\n\nCreative writing: It can be utilized to write a piece of fiction like story, song lyrics or poems.\nConversational agents: Generative AI models can be used to develop virtual assistants and chatbots that can automatically respond to user inquiries and hold natural conversations.\nTranslation: Generative AI models can swiftly and accurately translate text from one language to another.\nMarketing and advertising: Marketing and advertisement materials like product descriptions, ad copy, content for social media promotion and catchphrases can be generated.\nCode generation\nGenerative AI can be leveraged in software development thanks to its ability to generate code without manual coding. By automating the software creation process, these models reduce developers\u2019 time and effort in writing, testing and fixing codes. Generative AI models for code generation can do the following:\n\nCode completion: Completing a code snippet is easy with generative AI models like ChatGPT that study the context of the code to suggest the next line of code.\nCode generation: Thanks to its natural language capabilities, a generative AI model can understand a text prompt to convert it into codes.\nTest case generation: Generative AI models can create test cases to assess the software\u2019s functionality, confirming that it performs as intended.\nAutomated bug fixing: Developers can enter the code into a generative AI tool model like GPT, which then identifies and fixes the bugs in the code.\nModel integration: With generative AI, developers can easily and quickly implement machine learning models in their software based on a specific model, such as a neural network or decision.\n \n\nCollaboration\nWith the latest advancements in generative AI capabilities, personal productivity tools like email and word processing can now be augmented with automation to improve efficiency and accuracy. One notable example of the power of generative AI is Microsoft\u2019s use of GPT-3.5 in the premium version of Teams. This powerful tool enhances meeting recordings by automatically dividing them into sections, generating titles, and adding personalized markers.

Besides having a range of other utilities, these advanced apps can do face, pattern, and speech recognition.\nThis article explains artificial intelligence and its role in mobile apps, the resources required for development, and how to implement them to develop robust AI-powered mobile apps. Let\u2019s start with a basic understanding of artificial intelligence.\n\nWhat is artificial intelligence, and how does it work?\nHow does artificial intelligence enhance mobile app development? \nHow to use artificial intelligence in mobile apps\nBest platforms to develop an AI-powered mobile app with machine learning\nPoints to consider for implementing AI in mobile apps\nHow to build AI-powered mobile apps with React Native and Tensorflow? -an example\nBest practices for AI-powered mobile app development\nWhat is artificial intelligence, and how does it work?\n AI is not one technology; it is an umbrella term encompassing all software and hardware components supporting machine learning, deep learning, computer vision, natural language processing, natural language understanding, robotics, etc. Artificial intelligence enables machines to emulate human intelligence. AI develops algorithms with reasoning abilities and decision-making capabilities using machine learning (ML), natural language processing (NLP) and deep learning (DL). AI allows businesses to quickly process large amounts of data to extract valuable information. Companies use these data-backed insights to improve capabilities, increase productivity, enhance overall business and accelerate growth.\n\nNow, let us see how AI works.\n\nAn AI system is built by carefully reverse-engineering human characteristics and capabilities into a machine and using its computational prowess and abilities to exceed human capabilities. Understanding how artificial intelligence works requires diving deep into each sub-domain and seeing how it could be applied to different industries. Here are the key technologies behind the working of an AI system.\n\nMachine learning: ML teaches a machine to infer from past experiences and make decisions. It can identify patterns and analyze past data points to determine the meaning of those data points. This allows it to draw a conclusion without requiring human experience. The automation capability of AI for evaluating data to arrive at conclusions saves time and allows businesses to make better decisions.\nDeep learning: Deep learning is a form of ML that teaches a machine how to process inputs in layers to infer, classify and predict the result.\nNeural networks: These are based on the same principles as those involved in working human neural cells. These algorithms capture the relationships between underlying variables and process the data the same way as a human brain does.\nNatural language processing: NLP refers to the science of understanding, reading, and interpreting language by machines. When a machine understands what the user is trying to communicate, it responds accordingly.\nComputer vision: Computer vision algorithms attempt to understand an object by breaking it down and looking at its different parts. This allows machines to classify and learn from different images in order to make better output decisions based on past observations.\nCognitive computing: Cognitive computing algorithms try to mimic a human brain by analyzing text/ speech/ images/ objects like a human does and tries to give the desired output.\nHow does artificial intelligence enhance mobile app development?\nAI expansion continues to catalyze mobile app enhancement, making mobile apps smarter. These apps can be used to predict user behavior and make informed decisions enabling brands to learn from user data and improve user experiences. Technically, AI works with mobile app development from three perspectives: data, security and analytics.\n\nHarness the power of information with data\nYour application\u2019s success is directly affected by the quality and quantity of data it receives. Let us say you are creating a prediction app to help marketers. The efficiency of your application will depend on the data you have, which is used to feed machine learning models to predict. There is an abundance of data these days, but this does not necessarily mean that one should overwhelm the system with data. This will make it difficult for users to use your mobile app. You must have the right type and amount of data to make your app work efficiently\n\nSecurity is imperative\nWith growing digitization, security has become a key area to be paid attention to. Companies strive to protect the data of their clients and users at all costs, which makes security as a preferred feature in any mobile app. For example, we can embed image recognition features in AI-powered mobile apps, which can validate users and is suitable for eCommerce purposes. These apps must be reliable, secure, and fast.\n\nUnleash the power of big data\nResearchers are now focusing their attention on data mining which is the art of finding patterns in data and creating descriptive and understandable models to support large-scale data. It is crucial for finding patterns or correlations in large databases. These data can be extracted using machine learning and AI tools. Companies will find having AI-powered mobile apps dealing with large data useful. Different collection methods can make your application more efficient. This is because data collection can be difficult and requires much computing power.\n \n\nHow to use artificial intelligence in mobile apps?\nArtificial intelligence can increase app retention, engagement, conversation rates, and other factors. Let us take a look at how AI can enhance mobile apps.\n\nAutomated testing\nApp developers who want to ensure their app runs smoothly should automate testing, which is traditionally done manually. Nowadays, many tools help automate the process, which includes integration testing, unit testing and functional testing. As the number of tests and test cases increases, it becomes more difficult to manage all the tests manually, making automated testing tools essential for keeping up with changing requirements. These tools also make it easier to test different platforms and configurations (e,g. Android vs. iOS).\n\nContent generation\nAI-driven content generation is both an exciting and difficult aspect of AI-driven apps. Creating original content from user input can be a great way of engaging users and creating a great user experience. However, producing the required content for an app\u2019s success is challenging. AI can make content generation easier, including articles, blog posts, and reviews based on pre-existing information and templates. This also allows you to produce huge quantities of high-quality content quickly and easily that can be used in many ways within your app.\n\nIn-app personalization \nPersonalization is a great way to attract users and keep them engaged. AI-powered personalization allows you to adapt your app content to each user\u2019s needs increasing the likelihood that they will stay on your app or return. Additionally, personalized recommendations are a great way to help users find the right product faster. Let us take, for example, an AI-powered shopping app that recommends a pair of shoes based on your past purchases. It can also suggest items from different brands similar to the product you check out.\n\nUser behavior analysis\nAI can use user data to analyze user behavior and make recommendations based on the data. This could include showing specific information or action to certain users or groups or presenting different content on the website depending on their visiting time and location. AI can detect patterns in customer data, such as purchase histories or product reviews, and predict problems before they occur. AI can identify problems in customer data and flag them, so they are addressed quickly and efficiently.\n\nSuggestions based on contextual searching\nContextually suggested terms can be a great way for users to narrow down their search results. These suggestions are often based on the context of the query and can include data such as weather conditions, times of day, and location. AI-powered search engines can access huge amounts of data and generate contextually relevant phrases below the search bar. This allows users to save time by automatically entering every query variant, which can be a time-saver when using an app. The best thing about these suggestions is that they are auto-completed and formatted for the query. To complete their search, the user only needs to choose one of these suggested phrases.\n\nChatbots\nChatbots are a type of AI designed to provide information against user queries with proper answers based on the technology of NLP at the backend. Chatbots can be used in-app to help customers or as a way for companies to provide customer service. It is a good idea to have a chatbot to help users plan their trips if they use a travel app to book hotels or flights. Chatbots could also be used as part of your marketing strategy.\n\nFraud detection\nDetecting fraud is a challenging task for almost all sizes of businesses. Businesses lose billions each year due to fraudulent transactions. Hence, finding ways to lower these costs while providing great customer service is crucial. Artificial intelligence is able to detect fraud by analyzing customer behavior patterns and flagging irregularities that could be indicative of fraud. If someone orders something using their credit card and then cancels it immediately after receiving it, this could indicate fraud or a mistake. This situation should be flagged so you can quickly address them.\n\nObject detection\nMobile apps can use AI technology to detect objects. Integrating artificial intelligence with image recognition technology, apps can recognize people, things, places and other relevant factors. For example, AI could be used to aid in disease diagnosis. A staff member can upload a scan of an anomaly or a photo, and the underlying algorithm will quickly review it and determine if there is a problem. On the other hand, picture recognition software can dramatically speed up the process of claim resolution and underwriting in the insurance industry. This is done primarily by quickly and efficiently detecting dangers from social media scans and damage assessment from photos.\n\nDigital assistance\nVirtual assistants can recognize a speaker\u2019s voice and understand what they say. They can use voice/ speech recognition technology to perform any requested command. Users can interact with the software by simply clicking on it. Such assistants can save you a lot of time. They also allow users to use the application while driving or doing any other activity that keeps their hands busy. People with hearing impairments rely on voice recognition. Besides, AI can instantly create dynamic call scripts for sales personnel and modify dialogue ideas while assisting the staff in adapting to each call and providing the best customer service.\n\nEnhanced security\nWith growing hacking incidents, app users are concerned about security, particularly if they use solutions like mobile banking and online shopping that accept digital payments. The safer your app, the better it is. AI can help in this area, too, fulfilling user expectations. Artificial intelligence, which processes large amounts of data quickly and detects potential cybersecurity threats, can help prevent attacks before they happen by alerting you and other users. Your app\u2019s security will improve with time, as well-trained machine learning algorithms draw on past experiences.\n\nAI can also increase the security of your app\u2019s biometric authentication system by increasing accuracy and efficiency. This is done by turning biometric data such as fingerprints and facial scans into information that can be analyzed and matched to a database.\n\nPredictive analytics\nAnalytics is an integral part of any business. No matter whether you are in healthcare or retail, insurance or finance, analytics is essential to any business. Artificial intelligence will change the way you look at app analytics. Intelligent algorithms can seamlessly scan through customer usage data to provide insights that allow you to analyze past performance and predict what will happen in the future. AI can help you improve your business performance by predicting demand and analyzing user behavior.\n \n\nUnleash the power of AI and get ahead of the curve!\nLaunch next-level AI-Powered Mobile Apps with LeewayHertz\n\nLearn More\nBest machine learning-enabled platforms to develop an AI-powered mobile app\nAzure\nAzure is a Microsoft cloud service that offers a large support community, high-quality multilingual documents and many tutorials.

Hence, AI requires that we look at pointers different from what is required when investing in the mobile app design process, as it involves data to a great extent.\n\nIdentify the problem to be solved by AI\nWhile applying AI to a mobile app, it is easier to apply one process instead of multiple. When the technology is applied feature-based of the application, it is easier to manage and integrate to the best extent. So, decide which part or feature of your application would benefit most from AI intelligence. Will it provide a better ETA? Depending on this analysis, collect data from this field.\n\nGet to know your data\nUnderstanding where the data comes from is crucial before looking forward to AI app design. Identifying the data sources at the initial stage of data fetching proves helpful. Next, you need to perform data refinement, ensuring that the data you plan to feed into your AI module is clean, accurate, and not duplicated.\n\nUnderstanding that APIs do not suffice\nWhen it comes to implementing AI within a mobile app, the next major thing is understanding that using more API would not be useful. Although the APIs used for AI development is sufficient to convert your simple mobile app to an AI app, they do not support full-fledged AI solutions. You will need to do more data modeling to make your model intelligent, which is something APIs cannot do.\n\nAssigning metrics to measure the effectiveness\nIt is not worth having an AI or machine learning feature in your mobile application unless you have a way to measure its effectiveness. This can only be done after you understand what you are trying to achieve. Before implementing AI or ML in your mobile application, ensure you understand the goals.\n\nInvolve data scientists\nConsider hiring data scientists for your payroll or investing in a mobile application development company with data scientists. Data scientists can help with data management and refining, which is essential if you want to excel in artificial intelligence.\n\nFeasibility analysis and practical changes to make\nIn the previous sections, we discussed the crucial steps involved in implementing AI and machine learning in apps. However, before you move to final implementations, the following checks must be done.\n\nDo a quick test to determine if your future implementation will benefit your business, increase user experience and improve engagement. The most successful upgrade will make your customers and existing users happy and draw more people to your product. An update that does not improve your efficiency is not worth the effort.\nExamine your existing team to determine if they can provide the required results. You should hire more employees or outsource the work to an expert and reliable artificial intelligence development company if there is insufficient internal team capacity.\nData integration and security\nAny mobile app will need an advanced information configuration model in order to implement machine learning projects. ML deployment may be affected by outdated data that is not in the best format. Paying attention to data sets when deciding what capabilities and features will be included in an application is crucial. Over time, your app will perform well with well-organized data and careful integration.\n\nSecurity is an important aspect that should not be ignored.

This tool can train neural networks to help machines perform tasks allowing you to save a binary file containing a trained model. To create networks, you don\u2019t need to start from scratch. Instead, you can use Inception to build your model, which is a classifier.\n\nInception\nGoogle has created this tool for image classification as a pre-requisite, which is not only a powerful tool but also has been used to classify close to 2000 images.\n\nLet us explore how we can build an AI-powered mobile app that can perform image recognition with React Native and TensorFlow. This application will match the images correctly.\n\nThe React Native Components Include\n\nReact native TensorFlow \u2013 npm i @tensorflow/tfjs-react-native\nReact native Caffe 2 \u2013 npm i react-native-caffe2\nReact native coreml \u2013 npm i react-native-coreml\nReact native image ml \u2013 npm i react-native-core-ml-image\nUnleash the power of AI and get ahead of the curve!\nLaunch next-level AI-Powered Mobile Apps with LeewayHertz\n\nLearn More\nThe step-by-step process to develop an image recognition app with TensorFlow and ReactNative\nStep #1: Initial setup\nFirst, you would need to set up a new React Native project and install the TensorFlow.js library for React Native. The Tensorflow library aids the training process of deep learning models by providing tools to optimize and fine-tune them.You can do this by running the following commands:\n\nnpx react-native init myApp\ncd myApp\nnpm install @tensorflow/tfjs-react-native\nStep #2: Train the model using the Image Recognition API\nNext, you would need to train a model using TensorFlow.js to recognize the objects or images you are interested in. Several pre-trained models are available in the TensorFlow.js library that you can use or train your own model using a dataset of images.\n\nCreate a JavaScript file named rn-cli.config.js in the root of your project directory. Next, add the following code to label the TensorFlow model:\n\nmodule.exports = {\ngetAssetExts() {\nreturn ['pb', 'txt']\n}\n}\npb = extension of the output model\ntxt = extension of label file\n\nStep #3: TensorFlow to Assets\nTo this asset file, you will need to add the TensorFlow model to improve image recognition\n\ntensorflow_inception_graph.pb\nStep #4: Label Assets\nNext, you need to add the label output to the assets directory\n\ntensorflow_labels.txt\nStep #4: Initialize the tfImageRecognition API Class\nYou now have a model and a label. You can initialize the tfImageRecognition API class using the following card\n\nconst tfImageRecognition = new tfImageRecognition({\nmodel: require('./assets/tensorflow_inception_graph.pb'),\nlabels: require('./assets/tensorflow_labels.txt'),\n});\nStep #5: Call for Recognize Function\nThe last step is to help the model recognize the image that you have in front of you using the training set. Here is the code for the same\n\nconst results = await tfImageRecognition.recognize({\nimage: require('./assets/panda.jpg'),\n});\nAdditional step\nOnce you have a trained model, you can integrate it into your React Native app by importing it and using it to make predictions on new images. You would also need to build a user interface for capturing or selecting images to be passed to the model for prediction. Here is a sample code to perform the same:\n\nimport React, { useState } from 'react';\nimport { Image, Text, View } from 'react-native';\nimport * as tf from '@tensorflow/tfjs-react-native';\nexport default function App() {\nconst [prediction, setPrediction] = useState(null);\nasync function predict(image) {\nconst model = await tf.loadLayersModel('path/to/model.json');\nconst prediction = await model.predict(image);\nsetPrediction(prediction);\n}\nreturn (\n<View>\n<Text>Prediction: {prediction}</Text>\n<Image source={{ uri: 'path/to/image.jpg' }} onLoad={predict} />\n</View>\n);\n}\nBest practices for AI-powered mobile app development\nTo deliver a seamless and optimized AI-powered mobile app solution, you need to follow some best practices as described below:\n\nUse of a suitable code editor\nFor seamless coding and commenting, code editors are crucial. Sublime Text 3 is one of the best recommendations, which offers advanced features like shortcuts, search and split, and command palette and makes it easy to code.\n\nAnalyze raw data\nYou need to be familiar with your data in order to code well. Your input data can help you build training sets and improve your results. So, having the data available for the algorithm and enhancing your model is essential. You can only offer good results if you know what your raw data contains in it.\n\nUser-centric approach\nYour user should be in complete control. Your design should be clear and have the right features, eliminating any redundant or unnecessary parts. Also, ensure you comply with user requirements.\n\nMake use of the Python dictionary\nThe Python dictionary stores all data, and it contains fundamental values, each of which is unique. It allows you to store the information in a useful way. The dictionary stores data related to user IDs and profiles, making programming easier and eliminating the need to use if and else statements.\n\nUse machine learning tools\nYou might consider using the most up-to-date machine learning tools like:\n\nApple CoreML, which is a domain-specific ML framework.\nNLP\nGamelaykit\nCaffe2\nC++\nPython API\nTensorFlow\nUse of low-code platforms\nLow-code platforms are the best for delivering AI-driven apps that increase productivity and improve quality. These platforms facilitate collaboration and enable intuitive app development.\n\n \n\nEndnote\nIt is evident that AI significantly impacts mobile app development, making mobile apps more user-friendly, efficient, and accurate by integrating AI. Businesses can now process huge amounts of data in real-time and make informed decisions. AI can also help businesses stand out in a highly competitive app market by offering unique and innovative features. So, businesses should invest in AI-powered mobile app development to keep up with changing demands of customers and stay ahead of the curve. Both users and businesses can benefit from the power of AI in mobile applications, which is a win-win situation.\n\nReady to take your mobile app to the next level?

One of the most advanced tools in this area is ChatGPT, an AI-based chatbot that aims to evolve the relationship between humans and machines in a way that blurs the lines between the two.\n\nAs new models such as conversational AI and generative AI continue to be developed, ChatGPT has become a hot topic for technologists, industries, businesses, and societies at large. ChatGPT is a highly advanced tool that allows non-technical users to access powerful capabilities and reduces the time required to develop applications. Despite some concerns that it may replace human jobs, ChatGPT is going to enhance human cognition, giving us new opportunities to interact with the technology and making tedious tasks like app development easy. The full potential of the tool can be harnessed by developing an app, website, or chatbot. So, ChatGPT app development is soon going to be a new trend.\n\nIn this article, we will have a deep understanding of this emerging AI-based chatbot and how we can build an app with ChatGPT.\n\nIntroduction to ChatGPT\nHow does ChatGPT work?\nKey components of ChatGPT\nFeatures of ChatGPT\nHow to build an app with ChatGPT\nFactors to consider while building an app with ChatGPT\nBenefits of using ChatGPT for app development\nIntroduction to ChatGPT\nChatGPT is a significant step in creating a seamless connection between humans and a chatbot. It goes beyond what one might expect from a conversational AI. The tool is capable of handling complex questions and performing advanced tasks. The model architecture of ChatGPT is based on the Generative Pre-training Transformer (GPT) and is trained on a massive amount of text data.\n\nIt has the potential to produce human-like text for various natural language processing tasks, such as language translation, question answering, and text summarization. The model is pre-trained on a vast amount of text data and then fine-tuned for specific tasks. This allows the model to understand the complexities of language and produce more natural and accurate text.\n\nMoving into details, ChatGPT was launched by OpenAI in November 2022. OpenAI is a San Francisco-based AI and research company that has created many usable projects in the field of AI. This AI-based chatbot was developed to address some of the issues of traditional chatbots, such as limited understanding models and improvement capacity. ChatGPT auto-detects words and provides outputs based on the inputs given by users. The bot is easy-to-use and has already attracted over a million users.\n\nIt can be used for different purposes \u2013 all you have to do is ask!\nChatGPT is useful for a variety of purposes, including\n\nIdentifying keywords or topics for content.\nProducing personalized communications, for example, email responses or product recommendations.\nCreating marketing content such as blog posts and social media captions.\nTranslating texts from one language to another \nSummarizing long documents by providing a comprehensive overview of the full text\nAutomating customer service\nHow does ChatGPT work?\nChatGPT was fine-tuned using both Supervised Learning and Reinforcement Learning. The creators used Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) technique to minimize harmful, untruthful, and biased outputs. The technique consists of three steps: supervised fine-tuning, the reward model and proximal policy optimization.\n\nHow does ChatGPT work\nLet\u2019s understand each step in detail.\n\nStrengthen foothold in the generative AI domain with ChatGPT-like AI-powered apps\nDiscuss your project with LeewayHertz\u2019s AI experts\n\nLearn More\nSupervised fine-tuning \nIn the first step, demonstration data is collected to train a supervised policy model or SFT model. This data is collected by having a group of human labelers. They provide expected output responses to a list of prompts. The resulting dataset is relatively small, but high quality and is used to fine-tune the pre-trained GPT-3.5 series model. However, due to the limited data, the SFT model may still generate text that is not user-friendly and misaligned. Thus, instead of creating a larger dataset through human labeling, reward models are created by ranking the outputs of the SFT model.\n\nThe reward model \nThe purpose of the reward model is to give a score to the outputs of the SFT model, which indicates how desirable they are to humans. The process is based on the preferences and guidelines of the selected group of human labelers.\n\nTo achieve the reward model, a list of prompts is selected, with the SFT model generating multiple outputs for each prompt. The labelers then rank the outputs from best to worst to create a new labeled dataset. This dataset contains approximately 10 times more data than the curated dataset used by the SFT model. Once the new data is collected, it is used to train the reward model, which takes a few SFT model outputs as input and ranks them in order of preference.\n\nProximal policy optimization\nIn this step, Reinforcement learning is applied to fine-tune the SFT policy using Proximal Policy Optimization. The PPO model is initialized from the SFT model, while the reward model initializes the value function. The environment used in this is a bandit environment in which a random prompt is presented, and a response to the prompt is expected. Later on, it produces a reward based on the prompt and response.\n\nKey components of ChatGPT\nChatGPT combines various components, including machine learning, natural language processing, and others. This is to understand and respond to users in a better, natural and human-like way. There are also several technologies involved to improve the interaction. Here we will learn about each component and technology of ChatGPT.\n\n1. Machine learning: Machine learning is a branch of artificial intelligence that uses algorithms, features, and data sets that improve over time. With ML as an integral component, ChatGPT recognizes input patterns efficiently and responds to queries more accurately.\n\n2. Natural language processing: NLP is a significant part of ChatGPT that focuses on converting unstructured data, such as text or speech, into a computer-readable format. NLP involves several steps, including input generation, analysis, dialog management, and reinforcement learning. These steps work together to understand human language and generate appropriate responses.\n\n3. Data mining: Data mining is another important component that involves analyzing data using unsupervised learning. While machine learning focuses on making predictions based on current data, data mining is used to discover unknown attributes.\n\n4. Intent analysis: Natural Language Understanding (NLU) is a set of techniques that allows ChatGPT to determine the correct intent (or topic) of a request and extract additional information that can be used to trigger additional actions, such as context, account preferences, and entity extraction.\n\n5. Response generation: ChatGPT is the model for NLG that generates text using a convolutional neural network (CNN). Natural Language Generation (NLG), another element of NLP, allows the creation of text in a way that it resembles the appearance, emotion, and tone of natural speech.\n\nFeatures of ChatGPT\nChatGPT is a highly popular AI chatbot with several key features that set it apart from other chatbots.\n\n1. Text generation: ChatGPT can easily generate text responding to prompts, queries, or other input. It also generates text similar in style and content to the input it receives, making it an ideal choice for text-generation tasks.\n\n2. Natural language processing: ChatGPT is trained on a large dataset of human-generated content, which allows it to understand and respond to natural language input. This makes it useful for answering questions and providing accurate information.\n\n3. Contextual understanding: ChatGPT can understand the context of a conversation and generate appropriate responses. Users seeking answers to their questions are at a great advantage with this unique feature of ChatGPT.\n\n4. Customization: ChatGPT can be customized to generate text in a specific style or tone by training it on a specific dataset. This makes it versatile and attracts more and more users.\n\n5. Versatility: ChatGPT can be used for various applications, such as automated customer services, chatbots, language translation, etc.\n\n6. Cost saving and multiple language support: ChatGPT helps reduce expenses and costly resources by efficiently handling a high volume of inquiries. Additionally, it can support multiple languages, making it valuable for businesses with a global audience.\n\nHow to build an app with ChatGPT\nLet\u2019s understand the process of creating an app using ChatGPT with an example.\n\nConsider that we want to build a to-do list application using React Native.

The first view is for inputting new task and adding it to the list and the second view is for displaying the list of tasks and removing them. The component uses TextInput from react-native, which is a built-in component for inputting text.\n\nPlease note that this is just an example and you may need to customize this code to fit your specific requirements. Also, you may need to import some react-native components that are not imported in the above code snippet.\n\nPlease also note that, you have to save the file before exiting the nano editor by pressing ctrl + o and then ctrl + x to exit the editor.\n\nInput Query: How to import the todolist component in the App.js file and render it\n\nResult we got: \n\nTo import the ToDoList component in the App.js file and render it, you will need to add the following code:\n\nimport React from 'react';\nimport { View } from 'react-native';\nimport ToDoList from './src/components/ToDoList'; // import the ToDoList component\nconst App = () => {\n    return (\n        < View>\n             // render the ToDoList component\n        < /View>\n    );\n};\nexport default App;\nIn this example, the App component is importing the ToDoList component and render it as a child of the View component.\nPlease note that the above code assumes that the App.js file is located in the root of your project directory and that the ToDoList.js file is located in the src/components directory. If the component is located in another directory, you should adjust the path accordingly.\nAlso, you may need to import other components or modules that are used in the ToDoList component but not imported in the above code snippet in App.js file.\n\nInput Query: How to run the application\n\nResult we got: \n\nTo run the application in your React Native project, you can use the following commands:\n\nFor Android:\n\nreact-native run-android\nThis command will start the emulator and run the application on it. If the emulator is not running, it will start the emulator first before running the application.\n\nFor iOS:\nreact-native run-ios\nThis command will start the iOS simulator and run the application on it. If the simulator is not running, it will start the simulator first before running the application.\n\nYou should run this command from the root of your project directory, where the package.json file is located.\n\nPlease note that, you have to open the emulator or simulator and have the development server running in another terminal window before running this command. Also, you may need to open terminal as administrator or use sudo in the command depending on your system setup.\n\nAfter running this command, the application will be built and deployed to the emulator or simulator. If everything is set up correctly, you should see the to-do list application running on the emulator or simulator.\n\nIn the same way, if you want to add more functionalities to your react-native application, style the view container, or change its background color, input a query in the ChatGPT asking for the code and steps.\n\nYou can build a fully functional react-native application by following all the commands, steps, and code the tool generates. If there is an error or bug in the code, the tool also helps fix the issues by providing example codes and suggesting ways to debug codes. Thus, many other usable applications can be built with the help of ChatGPT \u2013 all we have to do is ask questions.\n\nFactors to consider while building an app with ChatGPT\nCurrent generative AI models such as ChatGPT come with certain shortfalls which need to be addressed properly to tread carefully while building an app with ChatGPT. Here are some of them:\n\nRemoving bias and toxicity\nAs much as we value the power of generative AI, we must acknowledge that with great power comes great responsibility. It\u2019s important to recognize that these models are trained on data derived from the vast and often unpredictable expanse of the internet. As a result, they can contain deeply ingrained biases and toxic language that may inadvertently surface in the final product. That\u2019s why responsible AI practices are more crucial than ever before. We must ensure that our AI models are developed and deployed ethically and socially responsibly. By prioritizing responsible AI practices, we can help mitigate the risks of biased and toxic content while harnessing the full potential of generative AI to bring about a better world. Additionally, to ensure that the output generated by AI models is free from bias and toxicity, it\u2019s important to take a proactive approach, including filtering the training datasets to remove any potentially harmful content and implementing additional watchdog models to monitor the output in real-time. Furthermore, enterprises can enhance the quality of their AI models by leveraging their own first-party data to train and fine-tune their models. By doing so, they can tailor the output to meet their specific use cases and improve overall performance.\n\nImproving hallucination\nWhile ChatGPT has the ability to generate highly persuasive arguments, it\u2019s important to note that these arguments may not always be factually accurate. In fact, this phenomenon is known as \u201challucination\u201d within the developer community, and it can limit the reliability of the output generated by AI models. To address this issue, OpenAI and other vendors are taking a variety of measures, such as data augmentation, adversarial training, improved model architectures, and human evaluation. These steps aim to improve the output\u2019s accuracy and reduce the risk of hallucination. If you\u2019re building an app with ChatGPT, it\u2019s important to follow similar measures to ensure that the output generated by the model is as accurate and reliable as possible. By doing so, you can help build user trust in your app and ensure that it delivers high-quality results.\n\nPreventing data leakage\nClear policies should be in place so that it can prohibit developers from entering sensitive information into ChatGPT, which could become incorporated into the model and potentially resurface later in a public context. By instituting these policies, we can help prevent the inadvertent disclosure of sensitive information and protect the privacy and security of individuals and organizations. It\u2019s critical that we remain vigilant in safeguarding against the potential risks associated with the use of AI models like ChatGPT, and that we take proactive measures to mitigate these risks.\n\nIncorporating queries and actions\nWhile current generative models are capable of providing answers based on their initial large training data set or smaller \u201cfine-tuning\u201d data sets, both of which are essentially snapshots of the past, the next generation of models will take things to the next level. These models will have the ability to identify when they need to look something up in external sources such as a database or Google, or when to trigger actions in external systems. This will transform generative models from disconnected oracles to fully connected conversational interfaces to the world. By enabling this new level of connectivity, it is possible to unlock a whole new set of use cases and possibilities for these models allowing a more dynamic and seamless user experience that can provide real-time, relevant information and insights.\n\nSo, as we move forward with the development and deployment of generative models, we must keep in mind this exciting potential for integration with external systems and information sources enabling us to create a new generation of AI-powered applications that are more useful, powerful, and impactful than ever before.\n\n\nBenefits of using ChatGPT for app development\nIn modern app development, artificial intelligence and AI-based development tools have become one of the key driving forces.
